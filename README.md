note:
this project is on hold for a moment as I try to find a new way to automate transcription. If you have any tips, send a comment! :)

# What's this about?

this is a working page for organizing episode transcriptions for the ·[Srsly Wrong](https://srslywrong.com/)· podcast.

some files may be auto-transcriptions that are rough, un-screened, or low quality, and need further refining to become fit for final release.

common things that need fixing include punctuation, spelling, capitalization of proper nouns, paragraph parsing, speaker identification, noting sound effects and music, etc.

you can leave comments and check the status of transcripts in the online spreadsheet: [Google Slides - Srsly Wrong Transcript Status Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NZRCbGlVOYUe-U29SthfSbojiDl4q_13pikidC31nxw/edit?usp=sharing)

the final versions of transcripts can be found at https://srslywrong.com/transcripts/

leave a comment if you have any thoughts, questions, advice, or just want to contact me.
