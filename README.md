# What's this about?

this is a working page for organizing episode transcriptions for the ·[Srsly Wrong](https://srslywrong.com/)· podcast.

some files may be auto-transcriptions that are rough, un-screened, or low quality, and need further refining to become fit for final release.

common things that need fixing include punctuation, spelling, capitalization of proper nouns, paragraph parsing, speaker identification, noting sound effects and music, etc.

check the status of transcripts in the online spreadsheet: [Google Slides - Srsly Wrong Transcript Status Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NZRCbGlVOYUe-U29SthfSbojiDl4q_13pikidC31nxw/edit?usp=sharing)

the final versions of transcripts can be found at https://srslywrong.com/transcripts/
