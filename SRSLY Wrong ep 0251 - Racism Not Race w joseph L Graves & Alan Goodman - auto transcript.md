Shawn
We now go to Papa and boy, where Papa is the idea of racism and boy is the pseudoscientific idea of biological race. 

Speaker
Papa and boy. 

Aaron
Now, Boy, Boy, pseudo scientific idea of biological race. Why are you still up at this hour? It's time for you. 

Shawn
To go to bed. Ah, Papa. The idea of racism. I don't want to go to bed. I want to stay up and sort people into pseudo scientific categories based on primary colors and hierarchies. 

Aaron
Now, now, boy, the way you're taking religious ideas around the great chain of being and natural, hier. Parties and the political program of dispossession, of indigenous people and enslavement of black people fitting them all together with a bit of scientific jargon to give it the authority of the natural sciences. So good as the pseudoscientific idea of biological race, you're making your Papa the idea of racism so. Proud right now, but there will be plenty of time to naturalize hierarchical society tomorrow. It is time for bed. 

Speaker
Ah. 

Shawn
OK, Papa. 

Aaron
Tomorrow's another day, another day for both of. 

Shawn
Us. I couldn't do it without you, Papa. The way you feed the common sense of society through self-serving political views of the rich and powerful. It makes it a lot easier to create a pseudo scientific reflection of those biases, using the language of science. 

Aaron
Ohh son, yeah, you know. Well, I came first and I gave birth to you, so it makes sense. 

Shawn
That's right, Papa. Racism came first, and from that came the pseudoscientific idea of biological race. Me, your son. 

Aaron
I'm turning out the lights, OK. Let it chip off the old block. 

Speaker 3
She is wrong. We are seriously. I will see you 3. 

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome back to the seriously wrong podcasts. Today we're joined by two special guests. Joseph L Graves is an evolutionary biologist, and Alan Goodman is a biological anthropologist, and they together have just written a book. Which is called racism, not race. Answers to frequently asked. Questions. Thanks for being here, Joseph and Allen. 

Joseph
Well, thanks for having us, man. 

Alan
And it's a pleasure to be here on seriously wrong I. Love you guys. 

Shawn
Oh, thanks a lot. So I guess first in the book, you argue that racism created the idea of race, I guess, like the common understanding would be that race is this thing out in the world, that it's somehow biological. And then from that arose racism. And in your book, you argue that it's kind of the opposite. 

Joseph
Yeah, that's precisely our thesis. We talked about, you know, the historical construction of racial ideas around human biological variation and that essentially it was an attempt to fit a round peg into a square hole. But, you know, when you have social power, you can force the the square peg into the round hole. And that's exactly what race science did over a couple of centuries. 

Alan
Yeah. And I would say, you know, just to add to Joe, that race wasn't anything that was out there in nature out there in society. It was something that humans created and they didn't create it as a scientific idea. They created it as a socio political economic justification for racist acts, primarily slavery and colonization. And so in order to justify slavery and colonization. Really forms of racism, you know, very, very virulent forms of racism. We needed a concept that would justify separating humans into different types of people. You know, hierarchically ranked, some governed by society and culture and governance, and others governed by lesser means. And so race was invented to justify race. 

Joseph
Yeah. And another thing that your listener should understand is that it didn't really start in science or biology as they understand it in the 21st century. At that time, creationist religious ideas in the Western world dominated how people thought about nature and creationist notions about the hierarchy of human beings. Played a very powerful role in how naturalists began to think about the new groups of humans that they were coming in contact during the European age of colonization and discovery. And these events happened, you know, together. And so they were sort of interdependent, but they also had an independence. Biologists weren't just thinking about variation in humans. They were thinking about variation in the the plants and the animals that they were discovering. And these things all mesh together. But the degree to which. You know the race concept in humans came about. It was driven by the sociopolitical agenda that Alan and I talked about in the. 

Speaker
Look. 

Shawn
So with this, the time frame for sort of the start of race as we know it, would this be like like the slave or colonial era? 

Joseph
Yeah, it really starts with the voyage of Columbus. And you know, there were theological questions that that jumped out right away with regard to the discovery of these new people. I mean, were they human? Did they have souls? Their physical attributes were different from those of Europeans or cultural attributes were different. So. This was a time period that, you know, European societies took over the Western Hemisphere and and also enslaved millions. Of Africans to build their plantation based agriculture in the Western world. 

Alan
So race as an idea. You know, we can't just say ohh it was developed here in this place in this time. But it developed slowly through time, became more and more important with colonization, stealing of Native American lands in North America and South America and obviously with slavery. But you know, there are a couple key points in time. One in the book we point to is 1492, as Joe said, that's when Columbus and Big quotes discovered the Americas and you know, so moving by ship versus overland, you know one. Saw greater contrast between individuals and of course. This Columbus was part of the the need to colonize conquest Christianize steel, land, steel, gold, etcetera. But in 1492 was also the year that Jews were finally expelled from the Iberian Peninsula. And there's a bit of quasi, you know. Proto racial thinking and that Jews were seen to. Be distinct by blood, so concepts of blood became part of race and then moving ahead. You know, initially during 1619 when the first enslaved. Showed up in the Virginia colonies. They were not treated that differently from indentured Europeans, but eventually they needed to be separated from indentured Europeans, and so laws were developed in the Virginia colony. Is to particularly consider all Africans to be one group of people, one race, another law to prohibit mating and marriage between individuals of European descent and individuals of African descent. And so all of this is before scientists really gotten involved and. It was really in the 1800s where scientists all of a sudden came in to not just make the idea of race, but to try to ratify it, make it seem real by, you know, putting the patina of science on it. 

Joseph
And again, it's not the science we know today. It was science based in the notion of the special creation of human beings along a definitive hierarchy. So theories of of race that developed in, you know, England and the United States had a lot to do with whether one thought that there was one. Adam and Eve and those people were called monogenesis. Or whether you thought there was a separate creation of different in Adam and Eves along that scale of perfection. Those were polygynous, and the reason why that was such a powerful theory because they posited that non Europeans were not members of the same species. And so in the same way that one has the right to. You know, domesticate a dog or domesticate a cow. Europeans had the right to domesticate Africans because they weren't fully human. 

Shawn
The is the idea that there was different atom and eaves for each of these races that were like ranked hierarchically. 

Joseph
That that. That's exactly what it is. Most so-called the pre adamite races. The theory of Polygeny came from the Swiss born naturalist Louis Agassiz, who, when he came to America, one of the first experiences he had, was seeing a person of African descent and feeling disgusted and then coming up with ways to try to explain why Africans were so fundamentally different from Europeans originally. Monogenic ideas dominate. Needed but close to the middle of the 19th century, the polygenism had completely taken over the discussion of race, and so you had some of the greatest names in American science involved in polygene. Of course, you, your readers, are probably familiar with Stephen Jay Gould's work from this measure of man. Which talked about, you know, I'm trying to pull this guy's name. Yeah. Yeah. Samuel Morton. Morton was considered the greatest person in American science in the 1850s. He had a huge skull collection at his laboratory, which. 

Alan
Samuel Morton. 

Joseph
I think now would be the University of Pennsylvania. You know, he measured and he he ranked groups of human beings based upon skull volume. And actually one of the most important pieces of work that Charles Darwin does is take on the polygenesis in the descent of man. In the chapter on race where he demonstrates, based upon the science at the time, that there was only one human. Species and not. Multiple human species. 

Shawn
That's really interesting. I I guess what I'm thinking about the sort of common sense here or what you like commonly hear people say. I feel like one way that people might approach it is like, OK, people from these different groups, they look different. They have different skin colours, there's a variety of differences that you can see between what we call races. Why is. Race, not biological in that context, because I feel like if I talked to like extended family members and stuff and said, hey, race is a social construct, they'd be like, well, but people look different and like, that's sort of good enough for them to believe that race is meaningful and by. Logical. 

Joseph
Alan, do you want to go first? On this one. 

Alan
Ohh sure. And Sean, your experiences, most peoples experience and and that's one of the the difficulties of this intractable myth is that like a Flat Earth like, you know, the sun revolving around the earth, our cultured brains. Yet train our eyes to see race and what we really see is variation. You know, physical variation. Most of that variation is what we call local. You know, we're all genetically unique, except for identical twins and yeah, human variation is obvious. It's out there. Race is outmoded and nefarious. Way that we've been taught. To describe and explain that variation, and like the little homunculus that was supposedly in sperm as a fully formed human, let's put that idea on the scrap heap of dead scientific ideas. So I'll I'll give you if I can. Maybe a simple. Graspable explanation and then a little bit more technical. One the simple graspable one I hope is that if you were to take a bunch of individuals, say in from different continents. Some individuals from Africa, who we might say are one race in Europe, another race, Asia, another race, and you ask yourself the question which two individuals might be most different from each other genetically. You know, have the most single nucleotide. Polymorphism differences from each other. Microsatellite differences from each other. You know, if you thought about it or you you used race as your kind of guiding principle, you'd say well, must be, you know, an African is different from a European or European is different from an Asian or something like that, that one individual. From one race must be most most different from an individual from another race. Well, that turns out not to be true, and in fact the correct answer is to Africans in general. On average would differ more from each. Other than even an African would from a European or Asian, and that makes incredibly great evolutionary sense, because Africa has the greatest genetic diversity of any continent. In fact, instead of just being different races technically. Europeans and Asians are kind of a subgroup of Africans. They came out of Africa, they were bottlenecked, there was pretty recently that they came out. So they haven't had time to develop that much genetic difference from African. Other than some superficial traits like skin color, which is actually really pretty recent evolutionary development to lighten skin color, probably about 6000 years ago. You know truly we're all Africans genetically. So I hope that that made sense as a simple like. Two Africans are more genetically different from each other than an African is from European. Action. The more complex explanation that Joe can jump in on is that population geneticist Sewell Wright kind of dealt with this question in the 50s and 60s of saying when can we really know that there's something like sub species that a species is really beginning to divide into distinct? Groups and types and he developed something called the. Statistic and basically what the F statistic is is it's the amount of variation found within the group over the total amount of variation in the species. Humans don't have that much variation to begin with, which is interesting, and F that is above .25 is sort of. It's thought to be beginning speciation, so an example East and Western chimpanzees that are very close to each other. Have enough statistic of .32, so even though they live close to each other, they're beginning to form something looking like separate populations of subspecies. Humans depending on what system you look at, their FST values are something like .12, so they're way below the threshold. For sub species, so race just doesn't work as an explanation for human variation, and it definitely doesn't. Work as a descriptor of human variation. If you want to know what explains the pattern of human variation, it's not continental, it's continuous. And due to evolution and the most difference, the way to explain differences between two groups is based on simply. Geographic distance. 

Joseph
Sean, I I honestly have to step in and apologize that my esteemed colleague went went for the nuclear option with regard to explaining the silliness of racial ideas. OK, because you know, when when we do the genetics of human population variation, racial notions just collapse. But the question you asked. 

Alan
Uh oh. 

Speaker
OK. 

Joseph
Was, you know, I'm talking to my family and they see physical differences. And they say, well, that means there must be races, but race doesn't even work at the level of physical traits, even skin color. So if we actually looked at the variation of human skin color, it's continuous across the globe, depending upon latitude. And in addition, if we were to use the evolutionary. History of human beings and then, you know, superimposed upon it. Skin color variation, skin color variation would not match the evolutionary history of our species. For example, if you look at Indigenous Australians. Who live in the tropics. They have dark skin like indigenous Africans who live in the tropics. But if you look at the genetic distance between Australians and Africans, it's actually further apart than the genetic distance between Africans and Europeans. And so skin color doesn't allow you to partition groups of human beings in ways. That makes sense given our evolutionary history and no other physical trait does that. Either. You know, bone density doesn't do it, tooth type doesn't do it, you know, general anthropometrics between you know, body size and body length. Doesn't do. It. Ashley Montague in the 1940s had pointed out this principle of discordance which showed that, you know, if we tried to do this with physical traits, we wouldn't get the same sets of relatedness that we know from the evolutionary and genetic history of our species. So if physical traits. Won't work. Then there's no way in the world that when we start looking at the genome that we're going to recover biological races. 

Alan
So why is this important? And one reason it's important because we pile so much into trying to explain differences we see in health, wealth, etcetera, as ohh they must be due somehow to innate biological and genetic differences well. That's ********. 

Aaron
Today's episode of Seriously Wrong is brought to you by race, just not working that well as a concept for what it's trying to. 

Shawn
Do it this way. Am map needs to get you somewhere and if a map isn't accurate, it's going to lead you astray. Now imagine you're trying to find a treasure, right, and you want a treasure map as it got the dotted line with the X. The treasure is but then someone gives you a treasure map that doesn't apply to the territory. Iran, which doesn't lead you. 

Aaron
To the treasure says there's mountains where trees should be, or there's water where the land should be. You know many mistakes you can make on a map. It could even just be like way too simplified. You know, it says. Go left and you're like, I don't. I can't even Orient myself on this map. It's just a green circle with two dots near each other and blue around it. And it's like that kind of represents anywhere on the planet. If you make it rough enough. But it's, you know. 

Shawn
Yeah. And according to the what's it called that little thing up in the corner that tells you what different symbols mean? The legend. Legend. Yeah. I think legends, right? 

Aaron
That's a word for it. 

Shawn
So maybe you're looking on the legend you're like, oh, man, actually, this whole time, the drawing of a tree has referred to a mountain. So I thought looking at the map that when I saw a tree that that meant that there was trees there, but actually this legend is revealing some of those trees are mountains, but not all of them. It says in small text. 

Aaron
Right. If you see a tree on a map and it's not a mountain, there probably will be trees there, though not always, and sometimes also the watered areas can include trees. 

Shawn
That that's just an example of a map not fitting the territory and just not working. 

Aaron
It's not a great map. And then you won't get any treasure. 

Shawn
So when it comes to the pseudo scientific idea of biological race, it is a type of map where the treasure at the end of it would be something along the lines of, you know, having justice, treating people well, having a society that doesn't enforce arbitrary historical social hierarchies onto innocent people, and so on. 

Aaron
And has a scientifically accurate understanding of variation amongst human populations and all that kind of stuff. That's the treasure. 

Shawn
And then race this idea of biological race because of the place where it came from and the way that it developed overtime, such a male. On map that you're going to be as fundamentally confused as the first map example we gave. 

Aaron
And that's why race just not working is the sponsor of the show this.

Shawn
Something that comes to mind is, you know, biological race isn't real. Race is a social construction. I can imagine some people saying then the answer to the sort of problem of racism is to ignore race or like sort of treat race as if it doesn't exist and put all discussions of race and racism aside. 

Joseph
You know you're making the standard mistake and the one that we're trying to redress with this book. And that is I never used the term race without modifying it. So if you're talking about biological races. Based upon modern evolutionary and genetic. There are no biological races within the human species, but if you're talking about socially defined races, socially defined races were created through the process of social construction, and they are very real. I always say they're as real as a heart attack because, quite frankly, ones social position in racialized societies. If the United States can give you a heart attack or you can end up with a knee on your throat like George Floyd. So socially defined race is real. It has real consequences with regard to where you live, what you eat, whether you're going to be killed by the police, whether you're going to go to prison, whether you're going to get a college degree, how much wealth you will accumulate across your lifetime, socially defined. Race is the subject of study in sociology and political science and. Comics, but it is a different concept from biological variation within our species, where the concept of biological race has meaning and and by the way, there are species that have biological races. We just don't happen to be one of them, yeah. 

Alan
Yeah, this is lazy. Is probably a nice way to say it to say that just because we don't have biological race, we should. Ignore this, you know. Let's just do away with it. And I trust that listeners and I trust most individuals, can get, as Joe says, that there are two different ways to think about what race is. One is that it's based in biology and the other is that it was invented by us. And I think it would be great if individuals could begin to say, yeah, I am seeing variation. But I'm seeing it through a racial lens in that racial lens is taught to me the day I'm born. You know, it's the smog I breathe that I'm looking at variation through race, and then one can begin to look at differences in life expectancy. Heart attacks etc. And say why is that so that there's such glaring differences in COVID rates, infant mortality, family wealth on and on and on, incarceration by race, if it isn't due to biology and it isn't? Then it's got to be due to history, current experience, maternal experiences passed on to their children, lived, experiences development etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So we live in a racialized society. You know, race is important. Countries like France tend not to. Collect data by race. And I think that puts them at a real disadvantage when it comes to human justice, because if you don't collect data by race, you can't recognize that there are injustices and inequalities by race. We do it. We don't do it well. The census is based on office of management and budget. Directive 15, the census categories. There's a little caveat saying these are neither scientific nor anthropological. Categories, but they are real categories. I mean, we live in a racialized society. We divide people by race and that social. 

Shawn
So in the book, one of the sort of thesis arguments is that the idea of race has effects in the world and gives cover to racism. So I guess we've got the three things, there's race, there's racism, and there's human variation. How do these things relate to each other? 

Joseph
Well, since we said that racism created race. When we think about the relationship between human biological variation, as we say, you know in the book, it's wonderful, you know, evolved in Africa. And I'm going to make this clear because people don't seem to really want to accept the truth of the science. Anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. Though we stayed in Africa for over 200,000 years before the first groups of humans began to migrate out of Africa in small groups over that next time period we moved around the world, acquired local adaptations which really weren't that much, and we were talking about things like altitude. Adaptation adaptation to starchy diet adaptation to Arctic conditions, you know, lactase persistence, being able to digest lactose after weaning. So these weren't really like, dramatic things that occurred during this migratory path around the world. You know, skin color and complexion changes as people moved out of the tropics. So that's what gives us our biological variation in traits that people see. But those, you know, the significance of those traits. With regard to our society is a result of a set of historical contingencies. In other words, there's no real reason why dark skin had to be associated with social subordination. It just happened. That way, that Europeans seized upon African bodies to transport to the new world to help them build their colonial empires, and that they, you know, carried out a warfare against the American Indians who lived there. And, you know, in the Caribbean, they virtually exterminated them and drove them off their lands in North America, these are all. Historical facts. But history didn't have to unwind that way. That's what that's what happened. So human beings have biological variation. But that's not what explains how our cultures then. Evolved how social hierarchy came into play, how people began to be willing to murder their neighbors to steal their things, to throw them in chains, to rape and pillage. Those things are not driven by our underlying biology. They are the results of the way cultures evolve. Decisions that people made and we didn't have to end up making decisions that way. We live in a world where we're a biological entity that has variation like every other biological entity. But amongst the species on this planet, we are by far the most vicious and the most immoral in terms of the way we behave. 

Alan
So, Sean, I'll answer your question maybe a little bit differently. The connection between race and racism couldn't be more intimate, couldn't be more connected. And, you know, I think to finally acknowledge that race is not based in biology. Race is an idea. It's a sociopolitical idea. Is not sufficient to overcome racism. Not at all. But I do think it's. Sorry parenthetically, the reason why it's so hard to do it is because it's invested. We're so as a society. We're so invested in seeing the world as having biological races. 

Shawn
Something that you say in the book is that race has a chameleon like nature which changes its appearance to fit the needs of those with political power. 

Joseph
And that's pretty much the way of all mallet last I checked. So let me give you an example of that. I mean, in the Roman Empire, the Roman Empire didn't have racial conceptions the way we have in the Western world past Columbus. But but they did come into contact with people who were culturally different from them. So the Romans thought. That the Britains Gauls and Germans were Barbarians of very low intelligence and they thought that Africans were civilized people of very high intellect. Now, what was the difference between then and now is that you know, Africans were allies to the Roman Empire and the Britons, Gauls and Germans were their enemies. Who were there fighting on the northern frontier? And so we can go through, you know, various. Historical, social, cultural context and notions of otherness change. Whether you know they're ethnic or religious or racial, depending upon who's in political power and who their enemies are and who they want to suppress. 

Alan
One of the issues here is that if race is to be thought of as a scientific concept, you have to be able to nail it down. You need to be able to define it. You need to have a slide rule, you know to say, OK, this is one race. This is another race and it'll be that way all the time. And so just think about trying to make prescriptions or medical recommendations based on race. If you've got this chameleon like concept that's changing not just from Roman times to the 20th century. But you know, throughout the founding, the first census in 1790, the racial classes are, you know, that the boxes that one could check off are entirely different from each census. They keep changing and changing and changing. One changes one's race, potentially 11. Goes from the United States to Brazil and this is not because one actually changes biologically, but simply the political structure. Users kind of box people into different races for different political and economic expediencies so yeah, it's it's a chameleon. And that's one of the things that I think few people recognize is how can a scientific concept be so different through time? Another thing is that the idea of who is white changes, there's been a lot of great scholarship on the development of the concept of whiteness. Kind of the hidden race of whiteness, and so. We tend not to think about white, but who is white has changed through time, and it's been of tremendous sort of political and legal consternation about who who gets allowed into the the club of whiteness, who becomes an honorary white. 

Shawn
We now go to the line outside club whiteness. 

Aaron
Welcome to club whiteness. Can I see your ID? 

Shawn
Here you go. I think I should all. Be in order. 

Aaron
Take a look at that. Yep, it looks all good. Ohh hey, your complexion. You look a little swarthy. What are what are? 

Shawn
You Italian? Hey, I thought Italians were part of whiteness. 

Speaker
How are you? 

Aaron
Now Italians are allowed in, but I just want to be sure. Look, I'm really sorry to have to do this, but we're gonna have to pull you aside for extra screen. There's going to be a DNA analysis. It's really with just the mouth swab. So one drop rule we're going to be objective about. 

Shawn
This what? What genetic markers would you even use for that? White isn't a genetic category. 

Aaron
We don't reveal which genetic markers we we there's a proprietary special. 

Shawn
Blend doesn't make sense, like if a person's half and half, why would they be assigned one race over the other? It's like kind of like white supremacist. It's it's. 

Aaron
I mean, if you had lighter skin, I would have just let you in without thinking. 

Shawn
About it. But I mean it's changed from week to week based on like the political context and like what the rich and powerful one, I mean they used to not let Irish people in. So the whole club doesn't make any sense. It's just like made to exclude people and be racist. It's like the idea of the white race. It's just like synonymous with white supremacy. I don't want this test. I don't want even want to. 

Aaron
OK, bye save the test. 

Shawn
Man, we need to abolish this club. It's just. This ****** **. 

Aaron
And that was the line up outside club whiteness. We now return to wrong towns. Got talents. Our next contestants talent is concisely explaining the history of race. Can they do it in the allotted time? Judges will judge. 

Shawn
Capital R race as we know it today, this particular form of racial consciousness is fairly new, although there's records going back thousands of years of human stereotyping, other humans, typically people who live outside the bounds of their society. There's historical records of people in ancient India, ancient China, variety, different. Places making consulting comments about the skin tones of quote UN quote, Barbarians and so on. People who live far away from them that aren't part of their civilization during the Crusades. There's this attempt by European Christians to retake holy lands. At that same time came a huge wave of domestic anti-Semitism with laws being passed that persecuted out grouped Jewish people and. Medieval Europe, based on their lineage and bloodline, this sort of proto racist mythology about different ethnic groups and outsider groups. With this idea of race as these large categories that we know today didn't really exist. According to Ibram X Candy and his book how to be an anti racist prior to the slave trade in Europe, there's very little evidence to suggest that Europeans had widespread negative beliefs about dark skinned Africans. But in the early 1400s, Portugal, trying to avoid Muslim slave trading routes, started making trips to Africa to take African slaves. It made the Portuguese Kingdom more money than taxation did. They had to invent a mythology. Why is the slave trade good? That's making us so much money. We want to say that it's not just about money to. So can you invent mythology that's going to explain why it's OK that we're doing this and what the biographers of the royal family came up? Was people were inferior. They're being saved by a superior civilization, giving them a chance to convert to Christianity, thereby saving them the first ever definition of the word race in the European dictionary comes in 1606, where they say race means descent. Therefore, it said that a man, a horse, a dog or another animal is from either a good or a bad race. So from the start it was a term that was used to rank lineages and categories of inferiority or superiority, but it was used in a much broader way than in the modern sense because you could, for example, have a race of fishermen. It wasn't about these essential categories of skin colours. Race is a very fluid term to them. At that time. You could be like a red haired race or have different races of Europeans or African. Places or a race of Indians. But there's no such idea as the white race early on during these time periods, the European colonists are making settlements around the New world. They're enslaving people, in particular enslaving Africans for use in their cash crop. In the book how race survived U.S. history, they outlined how the first illegal usage of the term white people came in the 1670s in Virginia, where there was increasing tension between the rich and the poor of all races. There ended up being a rebellion. What was called Bacons Rebellion, where working class people across racial coalition and modern terms came together to stand up against the rich. It wasn't a purely racial solidarity. Like classes bigger than race moment, they also forcibly seize land from the indigenous inhabitants of the area, took out racist violence on indigenous. Groups. This scared the rich to see that power existing among the poorer classes coming together, expropriating things, they knew that their head was on the chopping block, and so they put into law for the first time a definition of a white race in the 1670s in Virginia that gave different rights to white citizens and black citizens trying to create a wedge in this coalition, white workers in Virginia were basically given this. Bargain in exchange for subjugating black people. Further, they would give poor white people certain benefits in society, including better access to jobs, jobs that included in enforcing the racial hierarchy explicitly, the esteem of being white in society, that values that over the course of the fall. Centuries, the assumption that racial difference is embedded in the process of scientific inquiry first has roots in religious ideas. Different atoms and eaves for different races, and a divine hierarchy. A great chain of being becomes the sort of common sense pushed by the rich and powerful in society. To help enforce this distinction between lower classes and keep them divided. In 1735, Carl Linneus, the man who invented zoological taxonomies in general, invented a pseudo scientific taxonomy that ranked people into colors white, black, red and yellow, and ranking them with white at the top and. At the bottom, sort of in the eyes of God and his racist white supremacist imagination. And from there comes this sort of emergence of the pseudo scientific biological idea of race. So looking at the big historical picture here, there's discriminatory labels and essentialism that goes back in history to a variety of degrees at different times. But race starts as a hierarchical justification. For economic and social exploitation of either domestic populations, but especially foreign populations, and it goes through waves of. For centuries, ping pong between the common sense of the rich and powerful, and to institutions of pseudoscience, in particular the colonial era of white slavers getting rich off of African slaves is the sort of trajectory where the current sum or scientific ideas of race emerge first as a justification for slavery. Then as a tactic for the rich to keep the poor divided and then through scientific naturalization. As a justification for ongoing racial inequality. So that's the history of race as quickly as I could. 

Aaron
Oh wow, that that was amazing. 

Shawn
We love our history on the show. We want to thank you. For that, that's beautiful. 

Aaron
You know, we get a lot of talented people on this show, but very few people have the talent for history that you do. You know, a lot of singers, a lot of poets, a lot of dancers. And it's great. Don't. Get me wrong. But who had history, history of race? That's. 

Shawn
Amazing. Absolutely brilliant. 

Aaron
It's amazing. I hope you take. I hope you go all. The way. 

Shawn
Thank you. Thank you so much. It's always been my dream to go out there, try to briefly as I as I could and but accurately explain the history of the development of the idea of race. And it's just a dream come true. Just. To get this far. 

Aaron
You know, when he walked out there, I thought, what a schlub this person? No way. Going to be able to explain raise. 

Speaker
In the world. 

Shawn
Well, looking at each other is this bloke for real? The hush. 

Aaron
Well, you could just hear the hush go over the audience when he started and. 

Shawn
Absolutely beautiful. Absolutely incredible. So in your book, one of the things that you two do really well and really interestingly is getting into pernicious stereotypes around race. And there's about 100 questions in the book frequently asked questions. It's like the subheading. What do you think are some of the most pernicious stereotypes around race given cover by a pseudo scientific sort of? Biologics. Veneer. 

Joseph
Well, the most pernicious 1 by far is intelligence, and you can see how pernicious it is, because recently it was an Atlantic monthly, or The New Yorker, Allen. They ran the the really nice piece on Paige Harden and her book. 

Alan
Uh, God, I think the New York Times magazine. 

Joseph
The New York Times magazine, but also another very prestigious high profile. I think it was The New Yorker. So yeah, you know, and if they call you up and and attack us for getting the wrong magazine, I apologize. 

Alan
Yeah. 

Joseph
Guys, but The New Yorker ran this really slick interview and discussion of her of her book, where basically she, you know, claims to be progressive, politically progressive, but wants people to recognize that genes are really where it's at with regard to understanding human potential. And she carefully stays away from, you know. They've passed racial claims of intelligence, but still, she's everything she does in her book the genetic lottery. Is utilizing that same scheme of thinking, but just taking racial difference out because she, you know, admits that no one has found any genes associated with racial differences in intelligence. But you know, using that edifice, of course, racists and racialists are going to go off and go back to their, you know. Entered bottle of wine that you know Western society is the way it is because Europeans and and they might admit to East Asians being genetically more intelligent than African Americans and Latinos. That's a pernicious position that we demonstrate. There's no scientific basis for in our. Look. 

Shawn
Something I was really surprised to find out doing reading on this subject was to find out like how long this sort of like Bell curve type argument had been proliferated in the United States. And like the early evidence came from eugenicists who use a type of IQ test on the US Army and found the average mental age they claimed. Showing that, like across the board, all soldiers had a low mental age on their thing, but in in particular black soldiers. But it was like their IQ tests included things like recognizing brand mascots and stuff. So it's kind of ridiculous, but I I was really surprised to find that, like, over the last, you know, century. And a half, there's been this recurring thing of like, all these books written decade after decade popularizing these arguments, these racist arguments. 

Alan
Yeah, it's a little bit like, you know, the game of whack a mole. And you're right. Every 10 years or there's a bestseller, the Bell curve. I think the Pope had written a book at the same time. And thank God, you know, it displays the bell curve as the number one book on the New York Times bestseller list in 1994. And, you know, just a complete piece of trash. And basically what the bell curve was saying, and Arthur Jensen, who wrote a piece in the Harvard Educational Review and over 100 page article, one of the things Jensen said is that compulsory education has been tried in its field. And what? He was referring to this is back in 1969. Is that head start programs for poor blacks and poor whites had been. Tried. They had boosted the IQ scores of poor blacks and poor whites, but then after a few years after the programs, these little summer enrichment programs had ended, the IQ scores began to go down again. And so that was considered a failure. But that was an environmental intervention. That was very short lived, couldn't overcome prenatal influences entirely, couldn't overcome family poverty, couldn't overcome nutrition, couldn't overcome. Exposure to toxic pollutants. Yet people like Jensen interpreted those data as OIQ must be based in genes. And really, there's two kind of leaps, you know, big scientific errors, one that is that thinking that. A complex trait like intelligent. Is predominantly due to genetics and yeah, genetics does have some influence individual to individual if in fact we could figure out how the heck to measure intelligence, but the big big error is thinking that those unknown genes that help. Intelligence are somehow disproportionately found in certain groups and not in others, and that's entirely unfounded. And I can go further and say, you know, why do we even care? 

Joseph
Well, I mean, the important thing that we demonstrate is the difficulty of defining intelligence and scientifically that's not a trivial problem, because if you're going to make any sort of genetic argument, you have to be able to rigorously define the phenotype that the genes are producing. And so if you can't. Actually define a phenotype. Then you really can't do any genetic analysis. And the people in psychometry sort of caught on to that because they realize, you know, that there are different theories of intelligence. And when they tried to use modern techniques like genome wide association studies on large groups of humans, they returned really incredibly small percentages of the variants of intelligence. So for example, a 2011 study found looking at, you know, 10s of thousands of persons of European descent, they only could explain 1% of the variation of intelligence. That means that 99% of the variation in intelligence could not be explained by their analysis. So they got smart or smarter. They decided to use something that they could measure better, and that's educational attainment, meaning the number of years that a person goes in school or they would throw in, you know, the highest level math course taken. But once you start going to these social traits like how many years a person goes in school or. How many you know, math courses are the highest level math course. Person takes you're also throwing in all of these other unknown social cultural variables that you really can't account for very well either. So in the biggest study of this that was published in 2018 and that Paige Harden made the biggest argument in her book about which looked at 1.2 million persons of European. Percent they still could only explain 11% of the variation in educational attainment, which leaves you with 89% that you can't explain by the genetic markers. And by the way, they found over 1200 genetic markers explaining this 11% of variance. In educational attainment and so at the end of the day, we we have a science that's looking for a problem that it could potentially solve and and they keep doing this. And when Alan says, well, why do we keep doing this? The ideological value of being able to claim that the intrinsic attributes of a human being. Determined where they end up in a society is of great, great use to those who hold social power. And what Jensen argued, and Herrnstein and the Bell curve, was when black people at the bottom of American Society, not because of racial discrimination, not because of generations of injustice and poverty, but because they simply don't have the genes to compete in a fair economy. That explanation. Is never going to go away so long as we have economies that favor one group of folks. In other words, you know in 1990 there were 60 billionaires in the United States, and now there are over 600 billionaires in the United States. And as long as those folks can argue, the reason we're billionaires is because we're so much smarter than everyone else, that explanation is always going to have currency. 

Shawn
One thing that comes up in the book, and it's something I've run into in the real world when you're talking to people, so if you're familiar with Sam Harris, the atheist intellectual, at some point in the last couple of years, he started embracing these racist spell curve. Payments. And I knew people who were listeners of his show who were starting to get pulled in this really toxic direction and actually severed relationships over basically people caught up in this Sam Harris world becoming racist as a result of. This. One of the arguments that they were making is that, Oh no, this isn't racism. It's actually we're interested in. Helping everyone as much as possible, and these genetic differences between races, they've got medical implications because certain racial groups get different medical outcomes than others. Or have different susceptibility to diseases and stuff like that. And that's a genetically tied racial thing. That was the argument they brought to me. And I said, I don't think that doesn't sound true it. 

Joseph
Yeah. Can I can I can I get, can I get anything here because that's absolute and thorough nonsense. 

Shawn
Doesn't sound true the way you're saying it. 

Joseph
And we spent, you know, a Chapter 2 chapters explaining why it's nonsense. And. It goes back to those fundamental things that Alan and I discussed at the beginning of the book about biological variation. So the problem of course is that biomedical research and clinical medicine have never gotten on board. 20th and 21st century evolutionary and population genetics. In fact, I have a perspective piece with my colleague Dr. Andrea Darrup, coming out in the New England Journal of Medicine. In about a week or so where we explained this and the need to redo medical education around modern biological anthropology and evolutionary genetics and and across the last year. I've been involved in a revision of one of the most widely selling textbooks in pathology, Robbins basic pathology. The 11th edition now has repaired a lot of the false racial claims of the previous editions, and the two of us have been doing grand rounds, lectures at medical schools across the country. And we've been doing about one a week since we started in the fall. So we've talked at places like Hopkins and Harvard and MIT. Stanford is inviting us to speak at their DEI. I've spoken at Emory University of California, San Francisco. A lot of the major medical programs and these people are responding like, wow, we never knew this. So yeah, you know, I don't know. The Sam Harris guy, but I do know that there was a time period in which a lot of these supposed. Critical thinkers jumped on the racial bandwagon as an example of demonstrating, you know, their opposition to political correctness. And what Alan and I have always, you know, held up is that our arguments are not made from quote political correctness, which by, in and of itself demonstrates, you know, the positions they're coming from. Because anytime one challenges, you know, white male dominance of society, the first thing that people say is all you're being politically correct. No. We make our arguments. Based upon scientific correctness and also historical, social and political science. That demonstrates how these ideas get picked up and reified and weaponized against oppressed people. 

Alan
That was great, Joe, and I'll just add. So you asked raison, a medical form. You know I I go for bone densities and I so I'll ask the technician, Gee, why do I have to fill out my race and typically they'll kind of look at me strange and say something like, well, you don't have to if you don't want to. Or, you know, sometimes if you ask somebody that knows a little bit more, they'll say something like, oh, it's a proxy for genetics or something of that sort, but it isn't a proxy for genetics. It just doesn't work. There is no there there. 

Shawn
And something your book picks up on in this area is that the misconception that there's a racial? Element to what diseases people will develop. Means that sort of like a medical racism can arise where people aren't being given the treatment and screening that they need because their doctors think that they're racially not susceptible to disease X or Y. 

Joseph
Yeah, I mean, we, Andrea and I give it a really good example about a girl who is socially defined as black and who didn't receive treatment for cystic fibrosis because the doctors at that hospital didn't believe that black children could get cystic fibrosis. As well, Piezo African descent can get cystic fibrosis because in the United States, African Americans vary in their percentage of European ancestry widely, and so one can get a cystic fibrosis allele in their European admixture, and there are also variants. Of cystic fibrosis, which do occur in Africa. They're extremely rare. And so this girl didn't receive treatment until she was eight years old. Normally, newborns are screened for cystic. And get treatment right away. One African American man didn't receive treatment for cystic fibrosis until he was 54. So that's where these racial misconceptions lead us that people don't get the treatment that they should be getting because doctors are taught these racist heuristics. And the only time you really need, you know, a. Quick heuristic is when you're dealing with an emergency room situation and a patient is about the code, and that's generally not very often. So one doesn't have to use these kinds of heuristics to decide what kind of treatment a patient need. And so we've been talking about how to restructure medical education, including, for example in the newer version of Robbins, basic pathology, putting in inclusive images because things like, for example, skin tumors look different when you have dark skin versus when you have light skin changing the language in the book. Describing, you know, skin lesions as being salmon pink. Well, they're only salmon pink. If you have very light skin. And since 98% of the medical practitioners in the United States are persons of European or East Asian or some other descent other than African American. You know, they haven't thought about these issues as seriously as they should have because it, quite frankly, it's not impacting their communities the way it impacts mine. 

Alan
I want to add a little bit about athletics into here too, because I think it all relates and also has something to do with this kind of chameleon, like slippery notions of race. Not everybody thought this way, but the predominant opinion up to will roughly the 1940s. World War. To was that Europeans and Anglo Europeans were the cream of the crop when it came to everything. You know that they were the most intelligent. They were the most athletic. They were the brownies that they would survive. They had the best. Immune systems. And everything going for them. And then all of a sudden in the 1930s, especially that facade of excellence in athletics begin to have some major cracks. Joe Lewis and Jesse Owens to point to two points in the 1930s. Jesse Owens winning 4 gold medals at the Berlin Olympics, Joe Lewis becoming heavyweight champion and knocking out the German Max Smells. Thing and so without kind of even paying attention to it, all of a sudden, white European theorists began to sort of change the paradigm and say that. Ohh well, maybe there was a playoff between athleticism and things of that sort. And intelligence and one has to maximize one over the other and that this was famously put into a racial prescription. By Jay Philippe Rushton, which Joe has written quite a bit about and to say you know that in evolution we need to maximize one. Either you know, physicality and athleticism and ability to reproduce over intelligence or creativity and nurturing. And the point being at one point it was thought one way you know that all of these things kind of were part of the so-called lighting. Those facts and race. And then all of a. And they were divided up in each race, so to maximize, you know, certain characteristics. So it doesn't work. And basically the same logic follows through for medicine, incarceration, intelligence arguments. There simply is no there there, it's looking at. Something that crumbles in your hands. You can't point to it. And so that's why, you know Sam Harris's arguments about race and intelligence don't work. Nicholas Wade, who is a science editor, New York Times sort of said the same. Thing, it just doesn't work. There's no there there. It's just nothing. 

Shawn
See, I personally, I lived most of my life without having heard any of these pseudo scientific, racist ideas. It was only in the last five years or so that I encountered them online. I mean, there were some people who were. That I've seen online who are like explicitly like yes, I am an extremely racist person and this is my point. Of. View But there's also people who push pseudo scientific racism from the perspective that they're like, quote UN quote free thinkers. The term that Sam Harris used on his podcast. And for the many of you who don't know who Sam Harris is, he is an American. Atheist who is quite popular in the early 2000s. Yeah, he used the term forbidden knowledge to refer to something that is. I mean, it's in a lot of circles. It is kind of forbidden to be racist. But it's actually not. Yeah. So it it it's. But that's sort of the framing of like, that's how the advocates of people who, you know, sincerely claim they think that they're not racist, but yet they perpetuate and promote these sort of racist ideas. 

Aaron
Pseudoscience. In that podcast episode, Sam Harris describes seeing protesters against Charles Murray. Like being really mean to him at a protest, yelling or like, not letting him speak. I think they might have actually prevented him from speaking. It's been so long. I can't. Remember, but that is what made him feel like, oh, I have to talk about this. You know who he's being silenced like. There must be something there to it. You know, like it it's this attitude of like it it's it's really weird how once you learn this history and seeing like how long these ideas have been. Around and how persistent they've been across time and how much actual research and science has disproven them over and over again. And they continue to persist Despite that, seeing them like being pushed again and this time is like this, like outsider thing, they don't want you to hear the hidden truth. This forbidden knowledge, presented as this, like tantalizing thing that like they don't want you to know. The blue haired SJW's in academia don't want you to. You know, but like, really, it's just, like, repackaged centuries old racist pseudoscience. 

Shawn
Yeah, there's this kind of like dip, ****** anti authoritarianism in it. And like it's misunderstanding the shape of authority. In a sense, it's like you feel like like I can get this sort of urge to want to. Do something because it's. Forbidden or controversial and stuff, but being forbidden and controversial in itself isn't like a good truth barometer, even with like the majority of front facing institutions are ostensibly in some way or another anti racist committed to equity. And so on. As a matter of like how they position themselves in the marketplace, it is still the case that like an ideology of elitism, which includes a genetic determinist, elitism exists within the highest structures of power in society. But like yet, we shouldn't be configuring our position on factual matters based on who we're seeking to oppose. By itself, without actually evaluating the evidence. And I think that is what some of this sort of like ******* anti authoritarianism does and that like this is an example of that. The Sam Harris is of the world thinking that they're sort of like boldly speaking up for the evidence, by reheating centuries old seudo science that was made to naturalize racism and. 

Aaron
Slavery and then giving ammunition to legions of debate Bros and. Comment sections, Twitch streams, and elsewhere to once again, yeah, reheat these ideas and the extent to which you still see. Yeah, you still see these weird biological essentialist takes turn up in common discourse, especially in debating conservatives and what? Not it's very common in conservative circles to just continue to talk about these things as if they're true and to even use like new like terms to try and, like, give it another makeover for a new age because it wasn't working so far. 

Shawn
Ohh yeah, the one you were mentioning before is haplogroups. That's one of the scientific terms they use to sort of like launder. The pseudo scientific racism. 

Aaron
Yeah, it's such an effective tool in a debate too, because if, like someone doesn't know what that means and they're like, well, actually like, I'm pretty sure most biologists say that racial categories don't meaningfully describe genetic groups of humans. In any way, they can just like scoff at you and be like any modern biology person will tell you race does exist, so it just they call it haplogroups. Now, you know, look it up Haplo groups. 

Shawn
It's kind of like, you know, stupefying people by using fancy terminology. So in, in, in the context of like a. Twitch debate or whatever, which I'm I don't mean to endorse by. In the context, whether in a Twitch debate with a racist, if they can bring out fancier scientific terminology than the person who's arguing the anti racist perspective, and they don't know all the INS and outs of what all these words mean, and they don't, you know that then they can create the visual impression of a disadvantage or loss by using this sort of like. Fancy scientific terminology. And let's let's like the trend through this whole history, right of like pseudo scientific racism is to launder these racist ideas through the veneer of science by making things sound scientific and making people who question their conclusions seem uninformed on the science. If they don't know all the details and terminology of a field of study that's complex. 

Aaron
Yeah. And I feel like it's aided in this instance by this being a relatively new talking point. I've only seen this like relatively recent. So there isn't like a lot of good posts that if you just search like haplogroup race, there's no like easy like debunking out there. But if you like look into what Haplo groups are you see like from what I understand and I'm no expert in this, but a haplogroup is basically clusters of genes that. Are used as a way to determine ancestry using genetics. So there's kind of two big versions of haploid groups that get talked about. There's why DNA haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. And basically what these do is trace your genetic lineage back to mitochondrial EVE or the Y chromosome atom. There's like 2 human family trees based on the. Genealogy or the matrilineal genealogy that are spelled out through this genetic passing down and branching groups of things. So we run into problems is that if you sort people into haploid groups using this Y chromosome thing, you get different groupings of people versus haplogroups using the mitochondrial DNA. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Aaron
Chromosome stuff. But the specific thing I've heard people claim is that haplogroup H, which is the most common haplo group in Europe. They they were sort of making claim to it as if that's white people, but there's also other haplo groups that contain white people and haplogroup ape H itself is a subtype of RO, which contains a lot of different people. There's western Asians, N Africans included, some Ethiopians and Somalians. And RO is a subtype of R which is a subtype of N. And there's also Europes many, many Europeans spread out in different groups, both within the umbrella of and and other ones. So I guess in this thing, there's a race that includes, like most Asians, all European descended people, and a lot of other different groups. Mix together and then basically all haplogroups are a subtype of L even though there's like a rough thing where the L type is the L subtypes that are named L contain most African people that we would think of as Africans. May, but not all, not Ethiopians or Somalians. So if you glance at it, you can be like, oh, there's one type that contains nearly all Africans. And there's like 3 broad types, like maybe this is kind of a version of what race could be, but as soon as you start looking at the details, like every other time you try to like. Take these racial categories. People made and match them to biological markers. It doesn't actually work, and it only kind of works in this instance because you're looking specifically at a biological marker of ancestry, which is the same thing that, like some of the visual cues that race is based on, is meant to be a marker of ancestry. 

Shawn
So again, in this instance, like the other instances. As well, a scientific inquiry into the genetics of so-called races reveals that the map of race is utterly inadequate to deal with the genetic and biological territory is what you're. Saying. 

Aaron
Absolute. Really, if this is race then we need to radically rewrite the race map and all of those other things that we said were part of race have to be taken out of it like it's just DNA mitochondrial ancestry through your matrilineal line, like that's all it gets to be. It doesn't get to be all these other things that get mixed in because none of those other things. Match up to these groups. It's a nice talking point for them, but it really doesn't work when you take even the briefest look at. 

Shawn
It. Yeah. So it sounds like for people playing along at home who don't necessarily want to get into all the INS and outs of the debunking of pseudo scientific racism. It hopefully comes up in your life infrequently enough that you you don't have to arm yourself with that, but it sounds like most people, when they're encountering these pseudoscientific arguments about race, even if people are trying to stupify them with fancy words, it's it seems like it's safe just to be like, no, that's not true. That's not race. It race doesn't match that look it. Up. 

Aaron
Like, yeah, I feel like if there ends up being a discovery where they finally figure it out, like they finally find the race gene or something, I don't. Know like, yeah. It's I would have to it would, it would. 

Shawn
You're. You're not going to find out on at. Stream. 

Aaron
Yeah, it would. It wouldn't be some like obscure thing that like this person who was banned from Twitch but is debating on YouTube now, like, you know, for example, might say in a debate like it's probably it's not gonna come from there. 

Speaker 5 

Welcome to keyboard Warrior radio theater. 

Shawn
Hey everybody, I just want to warn you that my next post is going to be extremely courageously brave against the repressive intellectual regime of our society that denies the facts. I've been doing research on YouTube, Reddit, chance and I've uncovered facts which all major scientific authorities deny. Sort of a combination of cow. This malpractice and liberal hand wringing, they don't think freely, but I do. And what I'm about to reveal may shock you if you're closed minded, you may reject it. You may reject me and I just accept that comes with the territory as a free thinker. You're not a free thinker and I am a free thinker, so I should warn you if you can't handle true and hard facts. You might not like what I have to say. It might make you uncomfortable. Some people just have a disposition against thinking. Really. And they're too cowardly to admit it. One of the things I really appreciate about myself is how I never flinch away from the truth. I will valiantly go wherever the evidence and the data sends me, no matter how uncomfortable. And I know that is what my followers expect, and that is what I shall continue to deliver. 

Aaron
Wow, that's so. Exciting. I'm a new follower to your page, but such a free thinker as well. I love doing research to keep on the cutting edge of information. I'm waiting with bated breath. Please reveal what new discoveries have you made. What thoughts are being suppressed? What ideas have come to light? In recent years that aren't being talked about on the mainstream media, can you reveal, please? We're all waiting. 

Shawn
OK, here it comes. I've discovered that the political ideology of white supremacy is true because I read some studies done by white supremacists funded by white supremacist. So I'm racist. That's it. I'm I'm racist. 

Speaker 5 

And we'll see you next time for another episode of Keyboard Warrior Radio Theatre. 

Shawn
The the book is racism, not race. Answers to frequently asked questions by Joseph L Graves Junior and Alan Goodman. It is really just an excellent, excellent book covering a variety of these arguments we talked about today in more detail. And I want to thank you both for for being here with us today and having this awesome discussion. I think our audience is going to get a lot out of this. 

Alan
I think I want to say something about, you know, the crises that we're facing. And, you know, there are many, you know, the pandemic to global warming, to income inequality, to going down the totalitarian rattle. But. I think racism is fundamental to all of those and you know. So that's part of, I think the reasoning behind this book is that the connections between disentangling and race and racism and trying to face racism as one of the most fundamental ways that we do inequality in this country. And throughout the world, we treat people unequally through a racial lens. In that racial lens is again just a figment of scientific imagination. 

Joseph
We, we and. Alan meant to say pseudo scientific imagination. 

Alan
Thank you, Joe. Let's not put us in with those guys. 

Joseph
Seriously. I mean, you know what? One of the things is, what always has to be careful about using the word we because quite frankly, I never bought into this nonsense. So don't, don't use we when, when, when, when I'm in the room because I'm not, I'm not them. 

Alan
OK Joe, except my apology. 

Shawn
I I feel that way too. Like this is a side note, but a lot of the time people will say we when they're talking about sort of a large historical trajectory that predates them a lot. And I just want to be like it's you, you can you can say it wasn't you like you like bringing on this sort of like ownership and like identifying with this trajectory that is larger than you and that you're not really factually a part of and it's it's something that I always notice when people are saying we when really accurately we're talking about they were talking about. 

Alan
Yeah. 

Shawn
A specific group of people, I mean, and I think in the case when looking at like the pseudo scientific history of this genetic idea of. Phase is that it's also like my read of from what I can tell is that these aren't just like, you know, innocent well meaning people trying to do science as best they can, they're making like scientific errors and distortions in order to advance a political perspective. 

Alan
That's that's a really good point. I I think you know for instance, that you know it comes up a lot in discussions about global warming is that we humans, it's the Anthropocene and we've caused global warming. It's like, no, we didn't do it it. If anybody, it's a 664 billionaires that Joe mentioned that did it and it's capitalism, you know, it's not the we as in some individual in I don't know Burkina Faso or the Balkans or you know that. You know, and I fear that if we don't finally make some headway in facing racism, we're. They're screwed, you know? And I mean it, not just, you know that we're continuing gross injustice, but that we're never going to come together. And, you know, one of the metaphors Joe and I have used is that, you know, if we're going over a Cliff, be it, you know, global warming, be it totalitarianism. There will be people at color of color at the head of the line going over first, but we're all probably gonna go over. 

Joseph
Yeah, I mean, I obviously I agree with Alan that we are at an existential moment for the thin veneer of democracy that remains in the United States. And that if we don't act on issues of racial justice, we will lose what remains of democracy. And if we lose, what remains of democracy in the United States, democratic nations may fail across the world. And if democracy fails across the world, we're going to end up with, you know, the kind of totalitarian states that George Orwell. Imagined in 1984, you know, controlling. And the life prospects of everybody around the globe and and that for me will symbolize the beginning of the end of our species. In fact, the subject of my next book. I literally sent a book prospectus to my agent yesterday about the attack on critical race theory and and how. It's designed to be a cover for the seizure of power by white supremacists in the United. 

Speaker
Right. 

Alan
I I want to say something, updated Pollyanna. And you know, I've been thinking about the importance of education. And also I think the limits of education, you know, how societies change ideas and things of that sort. And we went back 1520 years ago, we would see a tremendous split between. How scientists were thinking about global warming, you know how, geoscientists, etc. And publics were thinking about global warming, and now the public is catching up and my fingers are crossed that we're we're going to do something similar with how we understand race and racism, that there's a absolute scientific consensus. You know, Joe and I are not on the periphery of this. We're just maybe more vocal about, you know, how human population geneticists, biological anthropologists, they all agree that race does not describe or explain human very. Creation medical journals are beginning to do editorial policies in which they say that, you know, we're no longer going to accept using race as a category for human genetic variation. And you know, so maybe with books like ours and other, you know, your podcast and others that we will all of a sudden see. A sea shift, you know, ground in public attitudes and we will finally make some progress in understanding that the differences we see in income, et cetera that we thought were maybe you know due to some mix of genetics and culture. Sure, are really due to different forms of racism. 

Shawn
Awesome. Well, I am, I would say cautiously optimistic and hopeful. I feel like there's been some good progress in the last 10 years or so in terms of access to information that people have. That seems true. But the point that Joe was raising about the critical race, the anti critical race theory movement and how that sort of white supremacist, that's the counter factor, right like. You've. People who are regular people, as in, like, not part of institutions who aren't trying to like pursue a a white supremacist political agenda, who are increasingly have access to the information to come to informed decisions at this and at the same time, we have these well funded institutions that are pushing the same way that they've pushed for the whole 20th century. Trying to push these these white supremacist values through institutions. I guess it it's it's going to come down to what we all do in the next. In the next however many years and how we fight against these things and and how we try to raise people's awareness. 

Joseph
I mean, Sean, the reason at least I collaborated with Alan to write this book is because I felt we were at an existential moment. We wanted to produce a tool that would help empower people to to move in the direction of fighting for justice. And it's important to to recognize when when we talk about we and them, I mean. People have taken sides on this. Issue from the very beginning. There were people who fought for anti racist perspectives, now they didn't always do it as effectively as as I would have liked and everyone was influenced by the context of the historical period in which they were living. But this is a struggle that's been going on. You know, a struggle. That scholars and everyday people have fought for justice against those who have been fighting for inja. Justice. But let me be clear guys, I don't have the luxury of the optimism that people of European descent have about social change. I I just don't because this country has repeatedly disappointed black Americans. OK, the fact that the Republicans. Stood against this the Voting Rights Act bill, just a couple of weeks ago. So no, I'm not optimistic. But on the other side of the coin, while I'm not optimistic, I have dedicated myself. Elf to fighting to the very end and and literally we're at a point. Where we should? Be recognizing that the end could be in front of us in the same way that intellectuals in Germany in the early 1930s understood what could potentially happen, and some of them decided, you know, to get out and save their lives. Others stayed behind and lost their lives. But, and that's literally, I think what we're facing in the United States now. So no, I'm not optimistic, but I will fight. 

Alan
I do think that, you know, we're fighting against way more organized and way more moneyed forces when it comes to the questions about 1619 project, critical race theory, etcetera. And I made the comparison to global warming. But even there, there are. You know, Yale has a Center for education about global warming, and there's nothing out there, really that compares. And you know that. Trying to push publics to really come to understand what race and racism is are really all about. So in that sense I'm with Joe a little bit pessimistic, but I think also that there are different ways to make change, you know, and I hate to reference. Back to the death of George Floyd. But you know that, I hope was a key moment where people throughout the country throughout the world said enough is enough, and so we'll see. And yeah, I'm gonna keep fighting too. 

Shawn
Yeah, that's, I mean, reading this book, I feel like it is just an amazing resource on all of these different complex arguments. They're all very intertwined. And if you're getting an informal conversation with someone who isn't aware of any of this history, and they're asking these sort of like, you know, maybe well meaning innocent but rooted in weird stuff, questions. I feel like this is just. Excellent, excellent resource. And like there's things from it that I've. Learned from reading it, even having looked into some of the stuff before. It's like very high compliments to the the both of you for writing this. It's it's just an excellent book and really, really appreciate not just being here today, but the time and effort that you've put into over the years to gain, you know, mastery of these subjects to pass on to other people. Yeah. It's just been an excellent conversation. Excellent book. I really, really appreciate it. 

Joseph
Well, thank you for having us, Sean. 

Alan
Thank you, Aaron and Sean. 

Joseph
Oh, I forgot about Aaron. Yeah, he didn't speak up like the whole time. Sorry, man. 

Aaron
No, no. It's all good. Yeah. Thank you both for being here. 

Joseph
And you know, Alan and I stand on the shoulders of great minds that came before us and because of that, we were able to see further and and hopefully because of what we've written and the next generation of scholars will stand on our shoulders and maybe, you know, see a way out of this nonsense before it's too late. 

Shawn
Yeah. And as your next book comes along, Joe, feel free to let us know when it's coming. It sounds really interesting. 

Joseph
Well, the the next book is actually coming out in the fall of 2022, and that book is called a Voice in the wilderness. A pioneering biologist explains how evolution can help us solve our biggest problems. So that's already finished. It's being produced by basic Books it publishes in the fall of 2022, the one I described earlier is one that I will start writing as soon as I get an opportunity to get out of these classes. I'm under this semester. 

Shawn
Awesome. Well, yeah, sounds really fascinating. And just having recently been reading about the history of the eugenics movement and the development of IQ and a variety of these interconnected. Things and in that journey I found so much information about these pseudoscientific white supremacist orgs that are well financed people like Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund, and like. 

Joseph
Ohh yeah. You know, the Pioneer Fund actually came after me. 

Shawn
To like to chase you to criticize and. 

Joseph
To sue me for making claims against their then President Jay Philippe Rushton. 

Shawn
How did that? When was this? How did this end up? 

Joseph
Well, you'll learn about it in racism. I mean, in, in voice, in the wilderness, which comes out in the fall. Don't want to get ahead. 

Shawn
Perfect. 

Joseph
Of the next book. 

Alan
John, I think you're gonna have to wait. For that one. 

Speaker 3
She. We are seriously. I will see you 3. 

Aaron
Next time on seriously wrong. 

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome to social Justice Kaleidoscope, where the wrong boys take a look at some of the intersections between different types of oppressive hierarchical constructs. This week we're going to be using the idea of biological race as our jumping off point. And we're going to be talking about the way that connects to other hierarchical ideas to help demonstrate how all of these ideas are tied together in the history of social hierarchy. The idea of biological race was a scientific version of a pre-existing idea which had a religious or social basis of a social hierarchy between different races, understood as being sort of designed by God. This way, to have a hierarchy between different races and in the era of science. These ideas became scientifically, quote UN quote constituted with the set of ideas that were designed to reinforce. 

Aaron
That yeah, it it's really interesting looking at so many of the different political issues of like major historical injustice and how so many of them in the last few 100 years ended up. Being taken in under this pseudo scientific biological essentialist framing of like this race is superior, and this race is inferior, and we've proved it with our calipers and whatever other motivated types of measurements we're taking. So it applies in that situation. But it also applies to. Men are superior and women are inferior, and we've proved that biologically. 

Shawn
Right. Yeah. And both of those contexts, the argument is kind of made through the assumption of a social hierarchy with people who are disabled being worth less than people who are not. Enabled. So there's like this ablist current through both the patriarchal pseudoscientific denigration of women and the white supremacist pseudoscientific denigration of people of color. 

Aaron
And just the straight up denigration of disabled people. Even if you did happen to be a man and white, you know, if you can't use your legs or are blind or so many things are autistic or homosexual, which was viewed as a disorder at the time or disability of some kind, I guess definitely a medical issue that was. Wrong with the. Person. 

Shawn
It even went so far as to encompass class. They had the term pauperism, which was treated not as a social state of not having enough money, but actually a biological state that you could like genetic like you could measure someone was medically a popper, was a belief that in the 1800s populism was used as a. Sort of like outgroup grouping, pseudo scientific, social hierarchical status. 

Aaron
Ohh yeah, I I've never heard of that, but that makes so much sense. You even you even think of like stereotypical rich people like ohh you don't want to get your blood mixed up with those riff Raff. Like I I think among the upper classes of like very wealthy people or land owning people throughout history, there's been a lot of that kind of sentiment. That there's like a there's a inherent superiority in a way that was first thought of as religious or given by God. They're the Lords. They're sovereigns. They're the people, you know, we're meant to rule over you because God said so. And then in the age of the Enlightenment, et cetera, becoming. Biological eyes. I didn't know that the pauperism though. That's. 

Shawn
Apparently, in 1891, the Journal of the American Medical Association promoted the view that criminality had visual identifiers and was about what came from a bad stock of humans. So there was people who were born criminals, and this in many instances would have a racial component but doesn't have an inherent racial. Component. I think the the first Gilded Age autopsy was done by this guy named Caesar Limbo. Oso and he noticed a Ridge in the skull that he believed was primitive and indicative of inborn criminality. So with all these different examples, in this context, it really it brings to mind, just like the authors say in the book, you know, these are structures of thought that are made to justify and made to naturalize the rule of the. Powerful over the powerless. So this social, hierarchical ideology is being. Put through the lens of pseudoscience to justify all of these preexisting things. The domination of women, the disenfranchisement and exclusion of the disabled and racialized slavery, whatever the desires of the ruling class in terms of what they would like to be naturalized and normalized, is given the sort of scientific veneer to create these. Pseudoscientific ideas of social hierarchies that are natural and the context that a lot of this stuff arose is the period of the transatlantic slave trade and the colonization of the new world, which had people living on it for thousands and thousands of years before the Europa. Arrived so not super new. 

Aaron
Yeah. And just like with race, once you start doing that, once you start dividing people into groups and calling 1 superior and one inferior based on the interests of the powerful people in society, it becomes this like self perpetuating thing, where we, like, create these categories and define people. By these categories and then project them out onto the world, shaping the way that we see and experience the actual world, which isn't this strictly hierarchical. Some people are ordained by God or biology to be better than all others, but a much more interesting state. Of difference and variation and complementarity. So it ends up. Reinforcing itself by perpetuating these myths of these, like essential biological categories, where adherence to the purported biological aspects of it become socially enforced. Like you see this a lot in patriarchy and gender issues, where things that have, like, literally nothing to do with anything that you could call a biological. Difference between men and women, like whether it's OK to wear pants or a dress. Etcetera. Become like tied to these biological things in really weird ways that like just affect peoples's perception of the world and reify these pseudo biological categories that we're using to justify pre-existing power structures. 

Shawn
Another example of that sort of thing they mentioned in the book. Is the difference in athletic performance between black and white athletes when it comes to swimming versus running, and obviously there's a long history of racist exclusion from pools as a result of that racism. Cultural differences in the amount of people who go into swimming from black communities as a. Built the highest performing swimmers at this current time tend to be white. That gets naturalized by racists as a biological difference, as if white people are somehow born to swim amphibians. But when you look at that historical context where people who are black were excluded from opportunities to participate. And swimming in pools and so on for generations, even though that's not the case today, it makes sense that those impacts would still be felt in the current population. 

Aaron
Yeah, that athletic stuff is so interesting too, because people take it so seriously and think there's these like, like, some races are good at some sports and not good at others. And I just remember reading a while back about in the early 20th century, there were a lot of Jewish basketball clubs, so there was just like. A sentiment at the time in those circles that you know, Jewish people are really, really good at basketball, which isn't the current stereotype about basketball. So it's just kind of one of those weird ways. Those things change over time. It's a different race that's really good at. Well now. 

Shawn
But the reality is, any scientists will tell you there is no genetic component. There is no genetic component of basketball reality. Another thing that we haven't mentioned yet, which is one of these crises that we face that's related to these sort of, you know, rooted into these ideas of social hierarchies and also has, you know, science. Versus pseudoscience elements to it is the environmental crisis, and one way this connects to everything is you look at these institutions promoting these pseudo scientific ideas of hierarchy of human beings over human beings. They were also promoting this idea, which also is rooted in religious ideas, but it's transmuted into a type of pseudo scientific idea. Of humans commanding and controlling the environments, humans having dominion over the natural world, which isn't like the normal inherent way that all human beings think about the environment. There's variation, of course, but the people who are victimized by colonialism, you know the African people who were displaced and enslaved by colonial actions. And indigenous peoples in the Americas who are displaced and enslaved by colony. Male actions. They tended to have views of the environment that weren't based on the domination and exploitation of it. So there's this institutional elitist institutional minority dominating the majority, which is something that perpetuates itself, you know, for example, even among men, you have the elite men who are oppressing and exploiting non elite men. And then there's other circumstances where the non elite. And are given advantage over, for example, women or white men are given advantage over, for example, black men. That whole institutional structure is related deeply with the with the context of the environmental crisis that we face, these institutions and social clubs built with the current situation that we have today. And in effect, and they believed, you know, at the time that these, the oil industry became what it was, these sort of biological ideas of race were commonplace. The eugenics movement was massively popular in the United States in the early 1900s, for example, including with the rich, powerful politicians and so on. And the results of this environmental crisis at this time. Although it is coming for everyone. The result of this environmental crisis at this time is a disproportionate impact on communities of color and indigenous communities in what's called environmental racism. All these outgrowths of these social hierarchical institutions have this deep interrelatedness, and I think our best chance at addressing these issues is to look at them as a whole holistically. And address them all as best as we can. So biological race. The idea of biological race is it's a pseudo scientific idea popup. Raised by elite institutions of command and control, where a small group commands a larger group based on hierarchical ideas of worthiness and so on, often framed in racist, sexist and always basically ableist terms that has the result of perpetuating the trends of colonialism, including the destruction. Of the natural environment. 

Aaron
It seems like hierarchical societies gotta go. That's the Social justice Collider scope. That's what I'm seeing. Looking through this, you know, fractally color of a kaleidoscope, you know. You turn it and the makes patterns because it's not really a fractal and a kaleidoscope, but you know, it's nice to look at things from a bunch of different angles and come to the conclusion that we should build an egalitarian, environmentally just society together. 

Shawn
So this has been social justice kaleidoscope. We can't get free unless we all get. Free.
