Warning. The world has now become too dangerous for anything less than utopia.
That's a quote from john platte.
He's right. Great point.
John. Yeah, he actually advocated in the 1950s for a universal libraries to be in everyone's living rooms, but he advocated for using microscopic books as a way to achieve that. So you have like, tiny books and you get like, tweezers out. And I mean, in a way smartphone is like having microscopic books. So just the size of bits and bytes on a hard drive, kind of thing. Yeah, I know. He was on the right course, for sure. Yeah, they do save materials having tiny books.

Working together to do the impossible or we shall be faced with the unthinkable.

All this could be. Imagine utopia.

Welcome back to the seriously wrong podcast. That was Aaron. And I'm Shawn, you might remember us from last time or if this is your first step episode. Welcome. This actually is the 300th episode but that isn't you can start with this one. Yeah, it's a fine first episode. This isn't like the sopranos where it's a strong continuity and you have to start at the beginning and to understand what's going on.

It's not like that. Not at all, it's more like the simpsons. You can just pop in on any episode and you'll understand what's up. It just made me think of like we're in season 9 now. Of seriously wrong. It's like we're like So here's uh, here's this week's big idea.

Here's the big thought, it is possible to, and I originally heard this idea from buckminster Fuller, but a variety of people made this point. It's possible to have a higher standard of living for every human being on earth all eight billion of us on this beautiful planet could have a higher quality of life than we currently do.

While at the same time, we could work within the limits of nature work within the limits of the planet, not bust through planetary boundaries, we could meet our ecological commitments while at the same time meeting and exceeding, our social commitments to one another to have a rich free vibrant life for every person on earth and literally, every single person on earth could have a better life.

While at the same time, we meet our environmental commitments. That's the idea. It's ecological luxury.

Humanities inherent desire to chuck garbage right in the ocean. And our ability is a species to capture that force for good with ingenuity and ecological. Thinking look human beings have an inherent desire to chuck their garbage. Into the infinite deep of the ocean blue. We all do it. Let's just admit it and you might be thinking, hey, I'm not even near the ocean.

I don't chuck stuff into it but remember that chucking garbage on the ground outside almost anywhere will end up in waterways like rivers and streams which are then carried out into the ocean. So even chucking your garbage on the ground somewhere in the middle of a continent. Very likely we'll end up in the ocean.

It's time for a reckoning. We all feed the mighty garbage eating mouth of the earth. Increasingly dirty oceans. We love it as human nature. We've been checking our crap into the ocean since we were swinging from trees, you're not a horrible person. Accept you, buckminster Fuller said don't fight forces, use them.

We can use this. All right, here I go. I'm gonna dump this huge bag of garbage right into the ocean. I'm so excited to this. There's some deep humans. Wait, wait, no, no. What about the biodiversity? The microplastics, obviously, we all struggle with the indexable urge to throw bag after bag of sweet garbage directly into the ocean blue but we have to overcome that twisted, internal desire, my friend.

Haven't you heard of ecological luxury production director at 2121 all food, packaging has to not only be biodegradable but the a beneficial food source for the ecosystems into which it's distributed a bag of garbage. Like this is basically fish food. Oh wow, our inherent human, desire to litter as being used to contribute responsibly to our ecosystem.

Wow I guess this really is ecological lectury. Some of this trash packaging. Even contains the seeds of wildflowers kelp azola and other local plants.

Community, for their individualistic. Crime of littering litter bugs are pardoned in ecological criminal court. All is forgiven. Yeah, it's really, it's more up to like institutions to solve these problems and individuals being moreistically, judged. Exactly. It's our job is the society to change production. If the things that we're producing are ending up in the ocean to make sure that's okay.

Now, back to our show,

Although capitalism has many, many downsets that we talk about all the time. It does have one beautiful upside which is how good it feels to spend a little money you know like when you want to buy something. Oh yeah. And then you're just like, yep. You're like deserve it, I can afford it and I deserve it.

Little act of self-love to just get something nice for yourself. Yeah, so seriously wrong is a listener supported show. We're able to do the show, we do and put the time and effort and thought into it that we do. Because of the financial support of hundreds, actually over a thousand generous donors who give six dollars a month.

I like to think of them as like, a shield against capitalism for us, like, people contributing to a big shield in front of us and like, capitalism is trying to blast us with like, poverty and whatever, and they're like, no. Yeah. These noble podcasters freezing in the rain wrapping themselves up.

Like, no, we have to podcast and all costs. And then, we're splitting one bean to eat and stuff. But then it's like and then the patrons come and they look at their financial situation, they're like, oh, actually it's six dollars. American a month is not going to. Yeah, you can buy groceries, you don't have to split one bean.

You can pay your bill. I'll put it together and it's like oh, and it's like

Bonus episode every month, and there's a great community on discord of cool people to talk to Yeah, we really appreciate the support and it it's a way to help independent left wing art, which in addition, to all those great benefits is something that, you know, I always feel good about it when I Didn't want to driven to artists and stuff myself, really that?

I really like. Yeah. So head on over to our patreon. Our patreon peter eon, I was thinking of funny ways to say patreon but didn't have enough time. Uh yeah, I mean they could all be funny. You have to say I'm enough times to make it funny. Patreon.com slash seriously wrong.

Yeah, and thanks everyone who already does that. And thanks, especially to the people who are doing it as a result of listening to this episode being like, wow, it is time. And if feels good and then they swipe the card and I'm like, oh I just got access, that feels so good.

That i, I love paying for stuff. I love these bonus episodes.

There's this common sentiment out there that ecology and luxury are on like two opposite ends of a spectrum. And to move towards one is to move away from the other and it makes it sort of intuitive sense. Like a lot of the things considered luxurious. In our society, our kind of wasteful because everything in our society is produced and sort of like, ecologically, offensive ways.

So, to produce more things or things that are just frivolous compared to things, other people need to survive, it feels like, oh, they just like a luxury producing things. We don't need is the opposite of ecological. So you know it kind of makes some sense, why people see these things as inherently opposed, but once we started thinking about this, it just felt like there was like a lot of areas where there were sort of surprising overlaps here.

And there's certain things where you're like, oh we could produce this luxurious thing in the more ecological way, if we make them more efficient or produce them in different ways from different materials or if we sh Culture. There's a lot of avenues. We're going to look at this question from about why these two things aren't inherently opposed. Yeah, when we talk about ecological lectury, the term luxury, here, it comes from fully automated luxury. Communism are fully automated luxury gay space communism. It's a bunch of variations on it.

It's kind of like lgbt where they keep adding letters. The basic argument of the fully automated luxury communist and I found this idea, exciting and fun. When I first encountered it I don't know how many years ago now at this point but it was kind of a meme. The basic theory of it is that we can use technology to liberate everyone that we can unleash the productive capacity of humanity and a new way and have like a technological revolution that frees everyone from labor frees Everyone from toil allows people to relax kickback around all of their own private pools. People of joke, like yacht communism and like kind of this promised to the working people of the world to the global masses. The billions without is that, you know, under our system, all of your dreams will come true and you'll have a beautiful wonderful life and you'll get access to all the nicest things in the world.

And this isn't appealing vision and it's something that can be achieved technologically, and that the left could be reinvigorated by this sense of we're not going to, you know, promise people hardship and sacrifice. We're going to promise to out compete capitalism at people. And we're going to go to the stars and we're going to use technology, it's going to be like star trek, and you just press a button and anything you want to appears to you right in front of you at all times. Yeah. No, it's just, it's amazing. It's a cool idea.

I still, I've got a big soft spot in my heart for the fully automated luxury, communism Star Trek, techno stuff. But the place that it tends to be criticized from is giving insufficient play to the ecological limits of the planet. Over promising, promising things that can't be guaranteed and particularly I'm thinking of another utopian current of thought, which we've talked about on the show, which is degrowth, and degrowth, and fully automated luxury communism are both subtypes of contemporary utopian intellectual movements. And while degrowth emphasizes the limits of the planet, it also emphasizes the capacity to have genuinely good lives in the context of not overshooting. Our environmental thing. So if you you can find um descriptions of utopian

Like but there's also going to be aspects of it that you do like and vice versa for that matter. We're all utopians here. Let's let's mingle a bit. Let's figure this out. I want to emphasize that they're both utopian movements because I rarely see that said but it's absolutely 110 percent true.

Like these are the two main contemporary utopian movements. Yeah. They're both utopian movements and they're both like positioned opposite each other as like two conflicting visions, the people who are proponents of one often have kind of like a straw man version of the other that they like to knock down or like, you know, sometimes there's strum any types of people actually exist and they're like, legit criticisms to be made.

I think we've, you know, maybe came more from a place of fully automated luxury, communism early on in the show and have been exploring more degrowth oriented politics and we don't think there's a contradiction here. Like we think that in order to have a luxurious society in the way

Take place within the confines of the ecological. If it's not ecological, it's going to crash and burn and it's not going to work, right? So, in order for a society to truly be luxurious, it has to be ecological. And in order for a society that is ecological to be worth wanting, it has to be something that gives people a good life, a life, maybe people wouldn't like the term luxurious, but I think like, in terms of wanting people to have comfort wanting people to have not only what they need but like roses as well cakes as well.

These things that like for an ecological society to be worthless, there has to be some luxury there. It has to be a little bit luxurious at least. Yeah. And we have these in-group out group dynamics and sides, tend to mix up their good criticisms and their cheap criticisms of each other.

They're straw man criticisms get mixed up when you're in the heat of the moment taking sides and so on but both sides also do claim fully automated luxury communists aren't like yeah.

Nascent in both of like yeah yeah and we're saying they're compatible but I think like it's not just that like we're making up some new like compatibility that like they already are compatible when they like when you really talk to them about it they're like yeah I made it'd be nice to have nice things even in a degrow society if we can.

Yeah, I mean there's yeah there's a variety of like little conflicts and debates that you could have along the way. Yeah. Degrowthis again they're not like well when people have to have shitty lives, no comfort. All the beds have to be hard. All the food has to be bland, nothing that people don't need is allowed but we want to self-consciously take these strands, figure out what is compatible about them and flush out this space where places where ecology and luxury aren't just not incompatible but are actively integrated that are actively not just compatible, but synergistic.

Exactly.

Breakup texts. I can't do this anymore. All this fully automated luxury communist utopian site. I thought it was cute, but today at the eco meeting, you embarrassed me so much asteroid mining. Really, what did you think we were at the tech, bro? Meeting the god. I just I can't take it anymore.

I'm breaking up with you. Wow, that's funny because I'm breaking up with you. This puritan eco-shaming. Holier than thou bullshit. Is not going to convince anyone of anything. You have a fetish. It's like, I'm smarter than you. I'm gonna take away the things you like video games are bad.

You can't fly on planes anymore. I have a set is you have a fetish. Your fetish is making promises that you can't deliver on. And the only thing you do deliver is more energy, throughputs more energy turning through the planet's resources. Called for that, I just called for using technology to make people's lives better and promise them something.

They'd actually want, you know, people like tech tech works. Why are we gonna have this weird puritan? Pretending? Technology isn't cool thing. Like technology is cool. Yeah, sure. Technology is cool. Whatever. Of course, it's cool it when it actually works but there are hard ecological boundaries to the planet that we have to hit now and just fantasizing about all this technology in the industry, propaganda articles, you're constantly sharing it just it ends up, turning into procrastination.

Oh, look, who's concerned about procrastination. All of a sudden when was the last time you cleaned the bathroom again? It wasn't that your job is that procrastination. Something that you're concerned about or is it just the selective theoretical procrastination? That my facebook shares have somehow encouraged global capitalism to continue being rapacious in the pursuit of profit.

Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot that my personal facebook page shapes the planet because I i didn't sufficiently make everyone not want to read my posts by shitting on the things they like speaking of shit. When did you first intend to clean the bathroom? Oh, was I supposed to? Do that for us?

Don't we have a fully automated luxury bathroom by now has an Elon Musk invented that yet can google sell my data of the shape of my bathroom to a robot cleaning company to clean my bathroom for me. Isn't that what you think the future looks like, is now what you want?

How dare you compare procrastination on climate to my individual procrastination, cleaning the bathroom, which as you know, is something I really struggle with Maybe it'd be easier for you to clean the bathroom. If we had a kumbaya drum, circle white dreads, small is beautiful, hay, bale bathroom with natural compost.

We can munch granola poop in a hole on the ground and braid. Our white dreadlocks into the branches of trees that connect with forest that would cause you to clean the bathroom. Hopefully, Yeah, whatever poop and hole in the grounds. Yeah. Just admit it. You don't even care about the environment at all.

Do you? As long as you got your toys? No. Obviously i've said like a million times. Obviously environment is good. We can use technology to help the environment. I mean that's one of the great things about technologies that allows you to do. Cool stuff. Environment is great. Green wonderful.

But you hate technology. You submit a school admit? It's cool. Of course, technology is cool and I never said it couldn't help the environment. The point is, we can only use technology that helps the environment. You don't seem to care about that. You just want any kind of technology, throw more technology at.

It doesn't even matter how much energy it takes or how badly it affects the climate. You never incorporate the climate into your analysis. You're basically a climate denier Look. I'm just saying it's good to give people nice things and good lives, but of course you can't destroy the environment.

Yeah, I'm just saying that you can't destroy the environment, but of course, it's good to give people nice things and good lives. Obviously, Oh my god, law. We are doing that thing again. Just like the therapist said, angrily agreeing with each other. Yeah, you're right. I the tone's, been off this whole time.

That's my fault. Obviously these differences are reconcilable. We're both committed to pretty much the same thing. We just have different focuses. What do you say want to give it another go?

And that is why you are the ying to my yang. The other spectrum on the same. Utopian continuum. Looks like our luxury communist and degrowth ideas are pretty compatible after all pretty compatible. Kiss me, you animal.

This is the lovely couple, I always knew they'd end up together. Perfect for each other, like two utopian angels, two puzzle pieces. And fits, I'll decide macaroni and cheese. Push push push push.

Ladies and gentlemen, we've had a safe bird. What are you gonna name? The beautiful child? Why I think. We'll name it ecological luxury. Beautiful androgynous name. I do want to acknowledge just that the outset that obviously not all luxuries are ecological and that like saying ecological luxury doesn't mean like every single luxury can be made ecological.

I think you offhandedly, referenced a private pool and everyone's backyard a moment ago and like obviously you can't actually do that because not everybody, like there's not enough space for everybody to have their own pool. Kind of there's no point in building, eight billion pools, but there is, we have enough space to coordinate both group pools for people who are the privateness of the pool is not particularly important and shared pools where you get private time in a pool.

That would be like the ecological luck that the circulating access to pools scenario means that you can have a sustainable reasonable amount of pools where people have access to that swimming without requiring everyone to literally build their own personal pool in their backyard, which would take up a lot of space and we go.

A lot of pools would go in used for very long periods of time. Presumably if you had eight billion pools on this planet. Yeah because sharing things sharing pools, sharing, all kinds of things. Brings about more access to those and it is a luxury, it's a luxury to have libraries.

And our current society, it's a luxury to be able to go and take out any book that your library has and read it and not have to pay and then someone else can take it out and read it. That's like it's an ecological lux.

It's a place where there's the synergy. So if there's pools that are available to obviously you can't take a pool out and bring it home with you but you can take time at the pool or use the pool in the same way that you can use the book and then other people can use it after you, that's a type of luxury and like that principle of like producing fewer things and allowing more people to have access to it.

That libraries have, or that shared community spaces, like pools, have is one of those areas where ecology and luxury like deeply overlap because the more, we share things, the more access to different things, different, nice things, different comfortable, things, different, luxurious things that we can all have. So the more as a society we have commonly held shared property managed in a way similar to a lending library.

The more access to luxury, we all have like inherently while producing less but getting more from it. Yeah. So the library economy, the dynamics of

Very, we talk about in some of our other episodes on library socialism, it's a place where you have that ecological luxury synthesis really, really effectively, because the material objects that we finish our life with. We can have more access to them with less ecological offense if we share them.

And I think also kind of implicit to the library economy is full recycling, which is the premise that everything that gets thrown out, is used in some way. There's no longer dumps where garbage piles up indefinitely, and not only that we're going to go into the dumps and we're going to pull out the usable material from it and use it.

So we're going to achieve a negative total sum of garbage is one of the goals of an ecologically. Luxurious society, we can go further by setting up, full repair, which is setting up institutions, that can repair things that have broken down where there's specialization where people can get training to participate and the building and rebuilding of the material objects that we all shared to make sure we get maximum use out of it and make minimum ecological impact from it.

Part of what that implies is changes. Also in manufacturing processes towards the prevention of things that are being made, just to break down quickly, things that are built to last that are actually usable. And so on things like modularity, have things be designed that

Easily. You can also have types of modularity that are aimed at general accessibility. Like, aim towards people who are less familiar with the technology or people who are younger etc, another luxury to this sort of system and this isn't for everyone. It's not a mandatory but the option to be able to learn how the things around, you work in greater detail and have people help you to take them apart and put them to together where it's not warranty voiding or something like that to open up your own phone and understand how it works and sub out parts over time and recycle and repaired.

And so on, that's a world that I want to live in a world where I can get my hands on the insides of more of the things that I work with and understand it better and have kind of a culture of doing that. Yeah. Because if we repair things, if we build things to last in the first place through production processes engineered to be as ecological as possible engineering things to last as long as possible and be repaired as easily as possible.

Again, that reduces the amount of production that we have to do. A production that we have to do reduces the amount of energy that we need to use to produce things. And then sharing those things that are really stirly built to last for really, really long time. Further reduces the need to produce a certain amount of those things because you only need to produce one book for 100 people to read at a library versus 100 books like you.

It's a massive reduction in the amount of production to share things and to build them to last for a long time. So, that's a place, where ecology and luxury are not only like not opposed to each other but like actively synthesizing one another. This idea of like building ecology into production along every step and building things to last as long as possible and thereby reducing the amount of production is luxurious for people to have access to a system like that.

And it is ecological, it's not even balancing the two of those. It's like more of one is more of the other. They're like not on two opposite.

Post to unecological disaster on the other end. Yeah. So in ecological luxury, there's the things that happen to be both luxurious and ecological. But then there's also this subcategory of things where there's this intense synergy between ecology and luxury where the luxury is enabled and structurally constituted from an ecological context.

Another one of these is time off of work, having a three-day work week, 20 hour, work week reducing the amount of time that people are spending at work is a luxury that is itself. Inherently ecological. It's a luxurious to people's day-to-day lives. If you're getting paid the same amount and having to work less.

So, how do you reduce work hours? Well, the fully automated luxury communists would say, use robots and automation to reduce work hours. And I think that's part of it to a certain degree. And the degrowth people would say, slow down the amount of work that you do overall. There's no reason to break our next hyper producing all the time.

We produce too much and we used two little like, let's have a more reasonable pace. That's also partially true. Yeah, both of those things combined, with sharing the things we build and building things to last, as long as possible allows people to work less, which is as you say in and of itself, a luxury like having more time to spend on things, you care about hobbies.

More time to spend with your family, your friends doing things, you enjoy. Games playing sports building things, learning new skills, there's like so many things that you could be doing that. It would be a luxury in our current society, to have the time to do so reducing work hours in and of itself is a luxury.

And it also has ecological side effects of like, you know, the fewer office lights you have on the fewer people, commuting to the office, the better in terms of energy usage in a society. And for ecology sake, we want to get energy use down to a level, to where we can sustainably produce, as much as we need to meet the demand.

And part of that is like, you know, how much can we produce sustainably? And part of that is, how much can we reduce energy? Use there are a lot of jobs in our current society that don't need to be done or wouldn't need to be done in the type of society that we're talking about like, you know, all the people who spend their lives coding drm in order to prevent people.

From sharing files, wouldn't be necessary and a society where all files are able to be

And television and research papers, and things are all freely available to people, you don't need to waste all this man hours on this arms war of like, people trying to get around copyright protection software and the people building up the software to cover the bugs and like this. Like it's all this wasted energy being spent on bullshit jobs, you can go back and listen to our episode with david graber about that kind of thing.

There's like people whose job it is to drive to the insurance office, 30 minutes, both ways in their gasoline powered car to sit in an office with the lights, on denying people's medical insurance claims. Like, that's your job in a society where people are provided with the medical care.

They need that job doesn't need to exist. There's people whose entire job. It is to walk around beside Elon Musk and tell him. He has great ideas and he's doing the best things. And to like, do his every little whim, that's another job, that doesn't need to exist. There's a lot of jobs in our society that don't need to exist.

Quote when he says, we can achieve this thing, better standard of living less ecological offense. If I recall correctly, he continues to say, we need to move from building. Something like we need to move from building weaponry to livingry, right? So I think i've heard that. Yeah, so he's critiquing the military industrial complex.

And the idea that we should spend all this money on more like, talk about, talking about bullshit jobs. Imagine your job is to train all the time to eventually kill your neighbors. How sad is that? Destroy infrastructure? That just needs to be built again. And we're going to spend millions and millions of dollars and new and more efficient killing machines to indiscriminately kill people, in the radius of bad.

Guys, and those people walk away for life with incredible traumaunted haunted by what they've done if they survive it all. This is mind-boggling. It's tragic in itself like yeah. And it's also just like if you want to talk about something that is in the opposite direction of both luxury and ecology, this literally the opposite of What was it?

Elizabeth Warren said. Something about. Greening the military. It's actually, I mean if you're going to keep the military, you obviously you need to green the military. So it's true in a sense like yeah in a way it's better. If the tank runs on electricity then gas but I guess like, but I mean, the military is just a an engine of ecological devastation.

It is an absolutely planet wrecking thing. It is you're destroying usable shit. Like you're just constantly destroying shit which then requires it to be rebuilt. Yeah, there's ecological devastate really nuclear bombs haven't been dropped many times in human history. Thank god. It's horrible environmental fall of from those but even just like weapons, manufacturing destroying, both human built infrastructure and like the natural world surrounding these places.

Like, you know, there's like you could go on and on about the ecological costs of war and I don't think anyone would argue that war is like a luxurious thing to experience on any side. So yeah, I mean the

And bystanders. I mean even just people who see it from afar are affected by war but the people who perpetrate war live with that for life psychologically that is an un that is an incredible misuse of human resources. Unbelievable shit, devastating. Tragic nightmarish really. So yeah we'd want to ecological luxury what necessitate?

A global peace movement as well. Absolutely. Yeah. It's another area where those two things like really overlap. Today's episode of seriously wrong, is brought to you by. Total recirculation full repair and complete recycling. In order to have an ecological society, advanced recycling will need to overtake garbage in our lives and trash pickup will need to be eliminated in favor of a system that recycles recirculates and repairs everything to the highest degree possible in a library society municipal waste systems and municipal libraries systems are integrated in a way where you can leave your library returns and donations on the side of the curb on a certain day of the week, like a recycling bin, and it will make its way back to the library.

Any item you no longer. Use will either be reused repaired by specialist or broken down into component parts, that can be made into something new. Manufacturing will be improved with an emphasis on longevity modularity, interoperability and repairability over obsolescence and waste class iron aluminum copper lithium and other metals are infinitely.

Recyclable, there are abundant stores of recyclable metals and landfills which can be rescued as part of a mandated of an extended waste man.

Landfills down to zero. And at the same time, rescue a useful materials from landfills, shrinking them to ensure a high material standard of living for all both domestic small scale and municipal large scale. Composting can take food waste and turn it into useful, fertilizer. That fertilizer can be used to grow food in municipal food forests, a library, social assist system of complete repair and recycling can provide a higher level of luxury to all while greatly reducing environmental costs.

Giving us more freedom and more ecologically. Luxurious lives, total research circulation, full repair and complete recycling, proud, sponsor of today's episode of seriously wrong.

Excuse me. Hi, human resources. I'd like to file a complaint. Oh, come in my boss made an insulting comment coming. Close the door. I'm so sorry, this happened to you. What happened. Tell me the whole story. Well, uh, sorry this is Makes me upset to think about, but absolutely.

Do you want water please with this slice of lemon? That's perfect. Thank you. So, Today, I showed up for my shift late, five hours late. And when I explained that it was because I had stayed up too late, last night playing video games. I was having a lot of fun with some of my friends playing online video games.

We didn't go to bed until the sun was coming up and explained all this to the boss and when I did he said try to get to bed earlier next time. And and it wasn't, it wasn't even. It didn't feel like a genuine suggestion. It feels aggressive. Yeah, it was aggressive tone on it.

Yeah. Well. I'm so sorry. Well, first on behalf of the organization, I just want to say that doesn't represent our values here. Thank you. Your contract. Very clearly allows for 10 sleepy days where you can show up as late as you want because you are too tired and you want to sleep in and let me get you use less than 10 this year.

This was only my fifth. Okay well i've heard enough I'm so sorry you had to go through that here again that is not what we do here. That's not the values of our firm or our society. More generally i'd been saving up my sleepy days all year. You have that right?

You know I was just really looking forward to using them and now I just feel it's awkward about it and like oh can I use them? Am I going to get more comments? I'm gonna put in a formal complaint about this. He'll get a warning. Won't be a serious question.

I don't know. Not to do it in a future. And is it a new video game or is it one that you've been playing a long time? Oh, a new one. Okay, well that makes sense. I mean, you explain that to him. I couldn't even get that far because I could already tell he wasn't interested.

Why they were important to me? So wow I think you should just go home for the day. We'll pay you up for the day and you can heal from this because that was just it was out of line and thank you that sort of aggression even a small aggression like that can foster resentments in the workplace and we want you to doing your best.

We'll have a talk with him. Thanks for sharing if you go home. Thank you so much. Human resources here truly on my side. There's certain things that are luxurious that would only be available in an ecological society. Ecology itself is a type of luxury like living in a ecologically harmonious society would feel like a luxury and is a type of luxury compared to living in a society.

That's like, destroying the biosphere. That's like, it'll be way more comfortable. It would be way more like, sort of that feeling of being like, wrapped up in something. Nice and cocoony. This luxurious like here in like a plush bed or something of any ecology that is healthy across the planet.

I feel like that's in another itself. A luxurious thing the part of your brain right now, that's like worried about the future, that's worried about the climate, and so, on, under our system, we would all have the luxury of not having to worry about that. Knowing that there are confident people who are looking at that being able to look at that information.

See, what's going on and see, like, no, we we're living within the boundaries of this planet. I don't need to worry that the

It's one of those things that shouldn't be a luxury, but unfortunately is to all eight billion of us even the most powerful among us live in fear of this, for good reason. And I find that area really interesting where the ecology itself is the source of luxury and that general existential dread isn't the only part.

I mean, biodiversity in general contributes to so many forms of luxury like the luxury of spending time and nature at the luxury of being able to observe and know about wild animals. Again, not having to worry about them. But also biodiversity connects to cuisine and the ability to make great recipes.

For example, you have a wider variety of types of potatoes, you have a wider variety of types of potato recipes, and therefore, a wider variety of luxurious cuisines to try and recipes to make. And so on. Yeah, biodiversity also benefits. Medical research. Having different compounds found in different plants.

Yeah. What if we accidentally made the cure for cancer? Go extinct before we found it. Textiles also, it's another way biodiversity.

Be types of fabrics that are better than our wildest dreams. We're yet to discover don't want to risk letting the greatest fabric of all time go extinct by being careless. There's also like building materials, biodiversity creates different opportunities for to make building materials or even like craft materials or paints and artistries.

Sort of things. Musical instruments things like shells are turned into musical instruments or like bamboo or reads could be turned into flute and so on. So there's all these different layers to the way that biodiversity contributes to luxury. I think it's safe to say that the loss of biodiversity is the greatest loss of luxury in history.

And if we care about luxury, if we're fully automated luxury communists, then we need to care deeply about the loss of luxury in nature, but also just like the experience of nature is a type luxury. Like people talk about like, you know, being able to have time or like a vehicle to drive to a public park in north america is like a type of luxury, and I think part of the vision of ecological luxury is redesigning cities to be more.

To increase the biodiversity within cities, more green space, more different plants, flora and fauna. We've talked before, on the show about how horrible car culture is for the ecology. And for the experience, the amount of luxuriousness of the experience of living in a city is like devastated by roads and cars being such a massive part of the footprint of all of our cities.

Yeah. Under ecological luxury, there's going to be a beautiful day where the people rise up against the roads on behalf of the animals and the plants take the pickaxes out and just just rip those bad boys out and just maybe you can leave a strip for you know, golf carts and like accessibility concerned.

We want people to be able to get around obviously they'll be public transport green train subway systems that allow people to get around cities but Parks building more housing on those space where those roads are with paths. In between it, we talked about whether everyone can have a backyard, the whole city can be your backyard.

It's like not just like a crappy lawn that, you have to like water. It's it's a well-managed ecology, every single city is. So there's like plants that are native to the area that grow. Well that it is where you are that feeling of like leaving the city or whatever.

And like going into a wooded area where you can no longer see the buildings or the road just for a little while. I'm being surrounded by the trees, the tower above your heads, and the mushrooms and the grasses around you. Maybe see an animal walk by. And that feeling inside of like a psychological stilling of anxiety, the sense of presence and connection.

It's like pretty universal experience, right? And like just positive psychological effects to spending time in nature and so it's uncontroversial stuff that feeling is a feeling that we should strive to be. Day of feeling that like between your dentist appointment and going to meet your friends to get french fries that are just as good.

But are safely our healthy for you as well, which will get into soon. Is another one of our promises. No, you're going, you're going to meet your friends for food and you're leaving the dentist office and in between your gonna have paths available to you. That are embedded in sort of nature that is an ecological luxury.

But also we need to be able to make the promise or set the goal, and I think the fully automated luxury communists are right about this is like what technological counter solutions can we pose for car culture that we can make that argument that we're going to be better than cars?

Like you're going to have better transportation options. So like individual carts that allow you to move through different environments. There's there's also like personal public transit. It's an idea that's been floated before it's kind of like between cars and buses. So you get the convenience of the individual movement but and that's something you'd be integrated and overall transit system that allows people to get around.

But also designing communities, where there isn't necessarily always the requirement to be constantly traveling, very far from your community. I think,

Area. If everyone has what they need within a certain area like a walkable community or equivalent, you know, 15 minutes or whatever then there's less of a requirement to have constant numerous forms of transportation. People can adjust the degrowth respective is that people could adjust their life to the ecological boundaries, the fully automated luxury communist perspective would be like we can make better ecologically, sound public transit that includes cars with new types of technology and be better cars than cars ever were.

And again, I actually think of both sides are kind of, right? Like we can, we can do both those things. Yeah, there's no contradiction between reducing the need to transport yourself across the city, by like, generally, having everything people need within 15 minute radiuses. To also like having easy transport.

If you do need to go downtown or whatever the equivalent of a downtown, it say there's a concert in the area, they're not going to have one in every 15 minute area of the city. You know, i've like

Downtown see the game or the concert or the whatever you can have both of those things. Be part of a strategy for how transport could work within cities but yeah I think yeah crucially another point about having cities being more filled with nature is not just that it's luxurious to experience nature to turn cities into a type of park, that's a luxurious experience, it's part of ecological luxury but it is also crucially, very good for the ecology, not just to remove cars.

We talked about the removing cars aspect of it but increasing the biomass of the planet having more plants and animals existing on the planet takes carbon out of the atmosphere. This is the same principle behind re-wilding which is that if you build up a whole bunch of trees and plants and animals and like the leaves fall on the ground and become part of the top soil, having more biomass on the planet inside of our cities and outside.

Deeply ecological thing that, you know, arguably is necessary in order to prevent climate change. That is also like, it's a type of luxury to have more nature both in your immediate environment for that experience, but also on the planet overall. Yeah, the more of the planet surface that is used by humans for, you know, agriculture cities, roads, etc.

The worst off for biodiversity. The more space that we give to wild nature. I can't remember the exact calculation, but there's just, it's like a direct ratio this much land equals, this much, biodiversity remaining, this much land equals. This smaller amount remaining, and so on. So the more you have the better.

So, Yeah, exactly. And then on top of all that we have the luxury of having even better animal documentaries. Uh, even more And I don't, I find a lot of people that I talk to about rewilding intuitively feel like, yeah, I love the idea of more plants and animals, that's great.

I've heard that we haven't been dealing with that. So, well, my entire life since I was a child. Like maybe it's time to start dealing with that. Well, it'd be such a what a wonderful luxury to not only have more larger parks and access to nature in your day-to-day life.

But no in the background that far away, there's enormous parks and enormous places with a lot of nature where you know where nature can just be nature. Yeah, like you said, since we were kids, we've been like, in this world of cutting, down the amazon jungle, like logging, like, just being like, nature being, like, reduced and reduced and eliminated, and destroyed a bulldozers running through the forest and scooping up all the trees and the poor little foxes and Dear and whatever else and just shoving it all into like, a wood chipper and and we just show up there wrong, boy, show up there and put our hands up.

Like, in the name of ecological luxury, put down your tools and all the workers are like. Wait, it's actually in our best interests and they like start taking apart the machinery and they It's kind of like that, same like mental luxury, we're talking about about climate change of like seeing it go in the opposite direction.

Like I don't know if I believe that there will be a point in my life where I'm seeing it, like, really going in the opposite direction. I'm just like, oh, that would be like what a beautiful thing, like seeing more and more of the world rewilding that like feeling of like, okay.

Direction on the same. Maybe we aren't even like fully there yet in terms of like carbon emissions being where they need to be or the levels in the atmosphere or the amount of biodiversity getting back to what it wants was but to like, oh yeah, we're doing like as a society we're moving in the right direction on that thing.

That would be a luxury. I don't care who you are. That's a damn luxury. That would that would be as good to me. As, you know, a fine glass of champagne or like a If even better than a diamond bracelet, you know. I think what are some like luxurious things.

I would never go on a yacht my whole life. If it meant that I could have that I would be I would be fine. Just you know you hear that. Aaron's gonna give up his yacht time. That means he's serious. I would also never gone yet. Let's do it.

We're all taking this big sacrifice together, guys. Which is in terms of ranking luxury is where I was going with it. That seems better to me than a yacht. It seems better to me than a diamond bracelet. Imagine you're like, you know, an eras and you come down the stairs and your billowing dress and your billionaire, husband is there and he says, darling, i've gotten you something for your anniversary.

She's like, oh, pray tell. What did you get me? My dear beloved, third necklace to put on my dueling crested neck. No, no silly silly. Not a mere necklace. I reversed climate change in biodiversity loss, darling. It's starting to my other direction. I've gotten all the governments of the world on board using my wealth and influence the amount of garbage that's currently in dumps is going to be reducing over time from now now on darling.

Yeah, I mean, if I'm the wife of that billionaire investor, that's the greatest gift you can ever give me. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, i'd be overjoyed. The biggest kiss on you for our anniversary for that. If that was our present, my present. Be if someone did that for you oh yeah that's just brings another for me and It brings another layer to it, you know, it's good and itself and it's just if it happened.

If someone else got it, I wouldn't maybe. I would be a little jealous. Actually, I'd be like, oh what did she do to deserve that? Secret gift. I'm out here. Grinding, on my podcast, someone's no one's butt. No one's getting there, but the reversal of historic trends on climate, but I mean, it is kind of the benefit of reversing those dark trends on climate, is that it's a gift to your significant other.

Yes, but it's also a gift to the world like that. Hypothetical billionaire, who did that, did kind of give it to you in a way not for your anniversary with him. Sure. But he doesn't care about me like that. No, but yeah point being it's luxurious the one here.

Anybody saying he called the gym and luxury or inherently opposed. Again after that example that just proved it. Yeah, that's bulletproof. This episode of seriously wrong is brought to you by the full integration of the ecosystem, into the city, with symbiotic, relationships between humankind flora, fauna and fungi cities are complex ecosystems, and it's time, we started trading them.

That way. Urban planning needs to take into account, not just the needs of humans, but the needs of all the plant and animal life integrated into the city, and the ways in which the city ecosystem, interacts and integrates with surrounding ecosystems. Life can be integrated into the city in ways that are useful to people through the expansion of urban green space ecosystems, including food forests, also hemp ozola.

And other carbon sequestering plants can be integrated in urban gardens and grown for nutrition. Biofuel green manure. Phytoremediation conversion to biochar or use in fabrication crafting and building materials some mushrooms including edible. Mushrooms can digest plastic and transform it back into usable material. The process of composting can be helped along with the use of bugs, like, black soldier flies, which also produce easily harvestable larvae that can be fed to domestic and farm animals, goats are a very beneficial livestock.

For urban, ecosystems in human use municipal goat, hurts can be fed that harvested larva and used for soil enrichment. Landscape management and to transform waste materials into usable materials, like wool manure. Fertilizer and dairy products. Goat digestion is particularly efficient at producing

Ends to congregate within cities reducing their status as a pests and making it easy to harvest. Their valuable guano city. Pigeons often eat food scraps, that make them ill resulting in droppings that can spread disease, but pigeon towers can provide high quality nutrition to local pigeons and their congregated droppings can be shoveled and used as a high quality fertilizer in many areas pest control for mosquitoes.

Could be handled by symbiotic. Relationship with bats housed in municipal bat houses which can also be a good source of fertilizer guano streams and lakes can be managed to nourish diverse and healthy. Animal ecosystems, including aquatic food for us for human, use aquaponics systems. Can also create synergistic loops between fish and human agriculture benefiting, both in the process municipal, urban fish ponds can also be part of urban wastewater systems using algae and phytoplankton to break down human waste and create oxygen, rich water for the raising.

It's within the city species that have been pushed out of human used areas. Including carnivores like wolves and grazing. Megaphone are like bison can be reintroduced to support biodiversity and strong eco communities. Protective corridors for these animals. To travel unimpeded can allow specialists to monitor and care for wild populations in cities protected, corridors and other animal-centric infrastructure for local birds raccoons, mice, and other wild animals can protect humans and animals from one another while monitoring.

And protecting the species that make up the ecosystem, increasing animal and plant biomass sequester's carbon both within the living plants and animals themselves during their life cycle because they're made of carbon. But also within the rebuilt, top soil that comes from reversing erosion and creating a thriving ecosystem, both above and below the surface of the earth, urban food forest ecosystems can be sustained and domed greenhouses to provide year-round public.

Friends by integrating flora fauna and fungi consciously into our municipal ecosystems, we can have richer more beautiful and more luxurious ecological lives. The full integration of the ecosystem into the city, with symbiotic, relationships between humankind flora, fauna and fungi proud sponsor of seriously wrong.

And I think there's a sort of contradiction that people don't recognize in the more traditional definition of luxury, you know, some of the objections you get to saying fully automated luxury communism or we should have a society with luxury. Is the idea that luxuries are by definition exclusive? They're things that some people get that other people don't get and if everybody gets it, then it's not a luxury anymore by definition.

And you know, if that's how someone chooses to define the word luxury that, you know, that's fine, I'm not, I can't change people's personal definitions, but if luxury is defined as like a comfort that is, based on exclusivity, then there's always like a aspect of non-comfort contained within that because if you're in a society, even if you're the richest person and our society, like we mentioned how rich people can't escape the fear of climate change, having to amass, great amounts of wealth.

In the society means having to fear it being taken Often means having to hire people to protect you. It's a fairly common thing, rich. People have to walk around with bodyguards. To have comforts in this society that are defined as luxuries is to constantly be in a state of anxiety and fear about them being taken away or losing them somehow and that in another itself, sort of undermines the comfort.

So, the idea that luxury should be defined as exclusive to me, doesn't make any sense because like, a true luxury is a luxury, is a comfort that is shared by all a comfort that we can all expect, no matter what? Whatever happens. These are things that are guaranteed within the society, that's a true luxury.

That's like a deep luxury, that's like a luxury that really exists in a way that more exclusive luxuries don't. Yeah, I think people can probably understand intuitively why a global library of things for recycling. And repair reduce and work hours. Focus on biodiversity, meeting our limits. And so on benefits, regular people who struggle and suffer and spend their time waiting for the work week to be over for escapism and so on, like the people who aren't making

Anniversary gifts. But we did say that we're going to make things better for everyone and maybe using that extreme example, we could give a few other quick examples of how this global transformation to library socialism and ecological lectury would benefit. Even the most powerful and wealthy amongst us because they are such a potent example.

They're the place where it's demonstrated that this system, ultimately fails everyone. And the example of the piece of mind about biodiversity in the environment is a great example. Another great example is how a global digital library makes people richer than rich and the sense that even the richest person's library under, the current system isn't as good as everyone on earth working together to digitize and scan, and create a global complete library, and all languages, all translations, all commentaries, all hyperlink and connected to each other and a space where everyone can have access to it for free, you know, with the library card being a human, you know, going on the

You are you can't access media that's not available to buy because It's, you know, it's in some rights limbo or I mean, maybe you probably could find a copy of it actually depend if it's like truly lost media then no, but yeah, there would be less truly lost media.

But there would also be a bunch of new media as well because of people having access to this repository of global ideas and have being able to experience different genres of the things that they are artists of themselves. It can deepen their practice and increase the amount of people producing great works because they have access to the global canon Even the, the rich and powerful or richer than rich, under our proposed ecological luxury system because they will get to experience art and writing and media.

And so on that would never otherwise exist. If the people who made them didn't have access to the library. They won't require, they won't need as much storage. They'll be able to access many or all of the same things that can access now. But without the requirement for a huge amounts of storage and maybe that's a minor thing, but I find property really burdensome Like dragging around my boxes when I move and stuff, I always just get in this incredible mood of Just loathing the concept of private property.

I can only imagine what it's like when it's on even larger scale, but I guess they get little Servant slave boys to do that kind of thing for them, right? Yeah. But even that like in a ecological luxury society, you wouldn't have to hire servants, who, like, surround yourself with people who kind of like resent you because you're this rich asshole is like paying them to Clean there.

Yes or whatever. Like rich rich people can get real friends. More often under libraries. Right. Not just people trying to game them to get something from them who is like or obscuring, what they really think because it's going to, they're worried about their family, being able to afford payments on the car.

Yeah, it would be like what a luxury to have like a true social connection with another human being. That would be like, really probably rare for like those highest elite people like Elon Musk? I don't know. Mike, maybe he has someone who's like a real friend, who is fully honest with, you know, like who he can talk to about stuff?

But I don't know, I think it would be hard for him to find that. It's made this weird making it personal a single individual, but They're just contemplating whether Elon Musk has friends. But yeah, I know it's hard to, like, I can make a friend even like, if he doesn't have them already, I don't know if he can make one right now, like maybe another billionaire.

Yeah, it's clear though that under this system, whether Elon has sincere, real friends or not, and I hope for his sick, he does, I can't imagine, it's hard to Yeah, I assume baby. Okay, but here anyways, but probably, but there's always this thing underneath it, right? This is the existential horror of capitalism for the successful.

It's like when he cracks as meme jokes. He can't be certain that the people around him are actually laughing at the joke or are subservient toads who are trying to get taste at the slot bowl. So they can afford their car payments. And in the soul of the rich man and the soul of Elon Musk, he craves the connection of knowing that the people are really laughing at him, right?

And that dissonance is existentially. Horrifying, you know, if you're planning in your life, you imagine yourself getting very rich and powerful isn't that terrifying that you could start being surrounded by like shadow friends? That yeah no. I i think there is genuinely something there. Like liberating for the rich and powerful to move instead to a fair system.

Mr. Spenceworth sir on line two. We have mr. Biasworth, they who is tied for richest man. In wrong town. I think he wants the menacingly debate your ongoing rivalry. Yes, yes. Thank you. Phone servant. Hello buysworth. How's your market-based solutions to the climate change? Looking last graphs from the scientists looking pretty dismal.

Spends worth. Your programs have voluntary corporate responsibility in awareness, raising aren't doing well, either the graphs are just as much. You're doing as mine. Well eyes, where we've been way ahead of you on green initiatives from the start, the paper towels in all of my businesses are made from 100 percent recycled materials.

And our idea for paper straws is working wonderful. Let the fight for paper stress, don't you? Dare take credit for that spends worth. I invented paper straws and the lid stays plastic. That was my idea. Well, we invented the coding that makes it. So the paper straws sometimes don't stick to your lips spiesworth.

Worth. I buy so many carbon credits. You lowborn fossil fuel loving dogs. Prepared to my green public, private partnership money, the screen capitalism stuff is going to make me a lot of money because I'm in on the ground floor buys worth, I invested on the ground floor and I'm going to be rich, you know?

Looking for even more. Esoteric ways to financialized nature into markets, boys. I donated 250 thousand dollars to planting mono crops for carbon capture. That's nothing I donated one million dollars to greening the military. Friends. I'm gonna do solar radiation management via particular sprays in the atmosphere before you and your cronies get too.

Oh and then I'll watch it from my privately owned spaceship. Oh my private space firm will be on jupiter's exotic moons by then living happy lives with our alien wives buys worth. Oh fat. They'll be able to stand you when the climate crisis inevitably does reach, its breaking point.

I'll have the most advanced bunker full weatherization, vast solar arrays, decades of food, stuffs, badminton court, tv on dvd. Bigger than mine, but my servant bunker casts will never rise up against me unlike your dumbass because I give them extended benefits. Yeah. Will they go rise up on you as if you can?

Truly protect, just yourself from climate change. Buys? Where I don't make me laugh, you're still ultimately doomed. Even if your bunker servants do not rise up, which I highly doubt. You are the one who is ultimately doomed, even your exclusive green lifestyle, private waterfalls. And electric cars has the the seed of this discomforting unluxurious ecological reality.

Oh. I suppose you're right by his worth, no matter how much we try to isolate ourselves individually from the effects of climate change, as ending up here and a bunker is a horrific type of doom and of itself. Spends worth even. Now we're lonely and alienated resigned to the inevitable death of people around us.

Just trying to protect ourselves and our families. Our knowledge about justice has to be actively suppressed just to have a basic level of comfort. It's a profound spiritual violence. Spends, I have a whole solar heated swimming pool out back, but nobody to swim in it with me, you know, it's almost as if luxury should be universal and ecological or it can't be luxury at all.

Sometimes I think this Correctly and libraries socialists might be, right. You can't just be for some, they're confederation of helpers is so helpful. Oh, but the luxury ecological library, socialist movement, want to take away our swimming pools and fleets of electric trucks and private waterfalls. Yards. They want to take her wardrobes or collections of shoes or garages my property.

You want to take it because no, my favorite Haven't turned against we own. I can't have it now, property, not yours. It's not yours. Oh, I am getting a call for my adult son. Sorry, i've got to go but screw you spends. Where With all right. Yeah, running away again.

Oh, I'm sorry. I have a son. Yo dad you got a minute to talk? Little billy buys worth. How are you doing? Oh, you know, pleasure to hear from you. It's a you don't call enough. I know dad. Yeah, I know, I just I was on safari here in africa, beautiful country this time of year, right?

But for some reason, nobody told me. It wasn't giraffe hunting season and I shot multiple giraffes. Oh and listen mistake, good kid the locals got upset and I just I'm gonna need your help to bail me out. You put me in contact with them, we'll get this settled up.

It's an innocent mistake. It's been escalated into the federal court because there's other charges, I had all this oil, we were transporting and it just I dumped it in what I thought was just like a trash can or something, but it turned out to be the spawning ground of some endangered species or something.

I can't remember. But the oil was just really heavy. We had to get rid of it. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about the heaviness of that. Like that. Oh thanks. It's one more thing to say them. Oh, do tell. I was I supposed You're not supposed to use molotov cocktails for hunting and dry season started.

A little bit of a jungle fire forest, fire situation, it spread to some nearby villages. It was kind of ecological humanitarian disaster. I think the headlines are probably going to be about the orangutans who burned alive, but many people did lose their homes. My billy boy. Well, we'll get the whole spin team on this and I'll pay over time for it and we're going to get you out of this pickle.

It's an innocent mistake. You know, it could have happened to anyone, I'm listening to the story I'm thinking there but by the grace of god go I we all make mistakes and we work to improve them but I don't want to dog pile. You right now. You're going through so much prison.

And, Products. And Everyone keeps looking at me like I'm like an asshole or something. I just If you come here, that's unfair their criminals as well. You help me out with this one. Of course, of course. Get me moved into a nice hotel or something. Absolutely. No. We'll do the calls, we'll take a series of calls and thank you, we'll all be very cleared up and those criminals will make sure they're punished even further for judging you.

You're the best. Well I just couldn't feel good about myself if I let my son rot in a jail cell for a series of escalating innocent mistakes, that sounds like you've been through enough. Yeah. This is a matter of conscience for me a boy. So I'll work on this a lot and very quickly, but I have to go Right.

Bye. So proud of you son, love you. So I think one of the main, if not the main real disagreements between like a degrowth utopian and a fully automated luxury, communist utopian is energy capacity. Can we find ways to have this highly automated utopian system? Do we have the energy for all this high tech stuff or do we need to scale back on technology, you know, maybe not even because it's wrong.

But just because it's just, we can't, like, we don't have, we have to stop using fossil fuels and the other stuff isn't there? And maybe never will be. I feel like that's kind of the like, a the energy concern. Yeah. So I think there is a, in the broad sort of like, degrowth ecological leftism, like the Half Earth Socialism guys, that we talked to earlier this season, we're talking about like energy budgets as a potential aspect of their Marxist utopia, right? And that's that's based on their analysis that I think is correct. And the current moment is like we don't have an energy pathway to keep on expanding and expanding

We're using year after year. And that part of the solution has to be in the short term withdrawing, the amount of energy that we're using. To a sustainable level. Yeah, and I agree with that. I think I'm more techno optimist than a lot of degrowth, people are. But if when rubber is meeting the road, in terms of the realms of actual politics scaling back tech to me, takes preced, we need to get the carbon output to a place where it's sustainable, that's the most important.

And the only feasible, way I can see to doing that is decreasing the energy that we're using right now, especially at certain parts of the world, I want to push back in a friendly way on just the wording of a particular thing. He said which is the scaling down of technology, the argument I think is that there's certain high energy technologies that they're not feasible on the short term so therefore technological capacity should be looking at low energy alternatives.

I think it's better to understood as pivoting technology towards ands that are lower energy and that can meet our needs. Yeah. I think the synthesis of these high energy and low energy perspectives is that the current moment is In particular, fossil fuels make up a lot of the energy we use.

So we need to be using less energy overall. In order to phase out fossil fuels, in particular in the time frame that we need to. Yeah, it's just the infrastructure. We currently have is like vast. Like there's so much fossil fuel infrastructure. That exists like part of me is like yeah we can just like expand solar panels, expand, wind geothermal all these things and like cover it all you know maybe in relatively quick if we did a manhattan project level type thing, 10 years, we'll all be living canadian energy, budget lifestyles, Part of me that believes that, I couldn't like argue that in terms of numbers, it's more like a.

Yeah, technology will just keep getting better thing, but I do believe that it will be possible, because energy technology does keep getting better. I just don't think even optimistically, like, changing it all over to like batteries and solar has like all these other problems of energy, going to produce those things and the materials needed to produce those things.

I just don't think, especially with that economic system in the political system. We currently have that. It's going to be possible to fully shift over to that without doing a huge amount of damage to the environment. That's the hand that we're dealt in the short term. And I think I have never heard no refutation of this.

That is in any way. Convincing

Aware of than the technological left. And I think this is something we need to integrate in a successful synthesis of these two perspectives. But the potential for the long term looks still similar to the Star Trek, sort of utopian accelerationist view as well. It's just, it's been an a more ecological container from first principles, right?

And I think it's pretty sympatico with both sides account of themselves and relation to the other but it's just the specific situation. We have involves phasing out, fossil fuels in a way that is going to have a little bit of short-term discomfort, you know. Worst long-term discomfort but even that short-term discomfort I feel like is mitigated by.

There's so many things where like you don't need high energy to have luxury. There's a lot of things that are just like kind of swappable doing things in a less energy. Intensive way that is for the most part just as good I don't want to say there's like no discomforts that would be necessary to massively decrease fossil fuel outputs but they feel like there's a lot of things that would be both equal logical and a lateral move if not better in terms of like the experiential aspect of it.

Yeah, I mean reducing people's workouts commenting, libraries. Yeah. Like these are all things that in the short-term can make people's lives much better. Even if the plethora of energy that we are used to is curtailed by capping fossil fuel use

Safe and raw resource materials and we're past the amount which is considered to be sustainable over the long term and the same time, we have this commitment to luxury and giving people of transition that doesn't have painful but especially unnecessary sacrifices on behalf of people when we can give them the best life possible.

We want our transition to work in both of these realities at the same time and understand that where they come together has something to tell us about what the transition should be. And the answer to that is library socialism, the commenting of public goods increasing rewilding increasing public transit.

Increasing renewable energy, increasing free time. Increasing access to information called culture. Increasing democracy. While at the same time, decreasing animal agriculture, decreasing military, decreasing unnecessary production, and, like, producing things that aren't good. Aren't built to last. Aren't sustainable our necological aren't accessible. More apparent to the average person than areas of the production of economy, slowing in a lot of ways like on earth.

We have enough stuff in certain sectors where like we don't necessarily need a year of production of certain subtypes of objects. Like there's sufficient amount of objects for our use on the planet earth in total. Like for example like we got enough spatulas like no more manufacturing spatulas for an entire year. Like let's see if we really start feeling that spatula pressure before we turn on the spatula button again. You know, like, Um I'm not suggesting that as yeah I mean as a strategy but it's a context that's interesting because it's true. It's like do we have enough? We have enough spatulas, but we just don't, currently have the social system so that if you're spatula breaks, it's easy to go and get another one of the available spatulas or where carry your spatula.

Exactly, in current society, the only way to have a spatula if your spatula breaks, unless you are really good at fixing. I don't know, is to go buy another. Newly produced one made from raw material. If 2024, we didn't make a single goddamn new cell phone on the entire planet, do you think there would be people who and you imagine the sum total of cell phones floating out there in the world and cabinets and dresser drawers and all the parts in those cell phones?

And which one like where is their three cell phones? That can be combined to make one cell phone? That's still works. Like when I was a broken screen one as you know you. Yeah. And where do you have someone who has a lot of working phones in? Right now, where is piles of unused phones?

And who can we just Scrooge McDuck with his room full of phones? But he just uses to swim and like a pool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably no phone villains in that sense and I think a lot of people would feel great to be relieved of their last five iPhone models if they felt the process was fair, and they weren't getting ripped off, and so on. Yeah, absolutely. But the iphone should be designed in a way that you can repair it from the get-go and instead of being locked out and having stuff designed in such a way that it's an impenetrable brick for profit so, after it breaks down, it needs to be returned to the company or turned into waste. Like, yeah, this is a shift in like, production and needs to happen at like, a base level of, like, thinking about everything we produce in these terms of modularity, rebuildability, repairability, 36 months, there's so many phones around that exist that are Capable of being repaired or used the increased. The amount of people who have access to a phone from what's currently at while also not producing anymore, there's a lot of like, mitigation of environmental damage that could have by having a, you know humanitarian pause on the deployment of mass consumer technology. What just until we figure out what's going on and then come back with modable repairable redesigned etc. You know there's a lot of ways that we can approach it and I think it's important that we approach it from a democratic perspective because I think one of the natural fears and it's a rightful fear is like, well you get a bunch of government guys getting together to decide what people are allowed and not allowed to do. Of like everyone loving with and agreeing the decisions of governments. Like small groups of people making decisions that affect the vast majority of people. That's why you got to increase the democracy. Yeah, exactly. So people having a democratic say in this process is important.

Yeah, I think you mentioned like you don't have like an authoritarian government just imposing these things on people. If we start doing the library stuff, first combining these like three phones, that could be one phone fixing the phones that exist. Creating this system where if there's a spatula, you can go get someone else's spatula, who handed it in when they moved in with their partner and combined to households and no longer needed two spatulas so they gave one away. There's that one's available to you, so you don't have to get a new one. If we start doing that first, then the pause and production wouldn't have to be like this imposed thing. You know, like first, it would just be a result of like, oh, we already have enough spatulas we don't, we don't actually. And maybe eventually we start needing to produce more spatulas, but for now, we just realized we actually don't need to. So, we stopped for a while that's in general with the ecological luxury stuff and the library socialism stuff in general, like these are a democratic and participatory process building systems that make things for people, make things accessible to people that people want to participate in because they see the immediate benefit of it, providing these luxuries to people that are ecological and people find them useful and convenient and attractive and comfortable and they want to keep using them and then shifting power to these Solutions, not by forcing people but by attracting them through the wonderful luxury that were like trying to build here.

It's like people doing it because they want to do it. Yeah. In terms of the energy thing, I think that the degrowth, the sort of energy pessimist side of, we don't have enough energy is right, especially in terms of our current infrastructure and like, Near future immediate what has to happen now. And I think the techno optimist energy side is right. And that if we keep working at creating sustainable ecological ways of producing energy, we can produce an abundant amount of energy to the point where we can, you know, maybe not quote, unquote uses much as we want. But uses much as we would want to meet our need.

Like you can't do everything in the most energy intense way just for shits and giggles, but you can do everything you want to do in a way that's using the least amount of energy possible. But enough to do all the things you want to do. Yeah. And I think generally that possible and desirable trajectory that we just laid out the lateral, transition to a commons economy, that involves a decrease in the use of fossil fuels, followed by a technological Renaissance that grows over time and eventually can increase.

Energy capacity is how we hold room and in our heart for both sides of these this wonderful utopian. Dialectic yeah, that's ecological lecture in terms of

- - -

Papa and boy.

Petroleum Papa I want french fries that taste just as good but are good for me too.

What is this nonsense Solar Punk Boy, that's not real.

I just think it's possible. I could taste just as good but also be good for you.

It's not possible. We need to invent to be possible.

Now, eat your unhealthy fries

Petroleum Papa, Fossil Fuel Father in other words.

Yes, that's me.

I heard on the seriously wrong podcast that you can have your cake and eat it too, If you're smart, if you're clever about it.

I told you to stop listening to them, boy. That's dead.

I'm a social ecological luxurion and library socialists. You have to accept that. I'm solar punk boy.

No, we are a plastic family and oil family. A fossil fuel family,

an ecologically. Beautiful luxurious vibrant world is possible. Dad, I'm sorry, but it's true.

Boy, don't make me punish you. We support smog in this household, you know.

Papa sometimes when you mix. Excellent together. And the alloy metal is stronger than either of the original metals. That synergy that's complementarity. That's what we're trying to do. On a society wide level a usufructian library economy, complete recycling, full repair rich, urban ecosystems that embed humanity in nature and provide for everyone without ecological offense.

Oh the ecology's offended by the fossil fuels. Now really, this cancel-culture is going to too far boy, when are you going to give up these childish utopian dreams?

They're not childish and they're not dreams, they utopian realities. It's a type of reality called a potentiality dad. I've already explained, This potentialities are in a sense real

keep saying that I'm going to put you to work on the family oil rig until you're an Oil Boy like your Oil Papa, get you to breathe in some plastic fumes. Set your head straight.

Papa, I'm working on developing it in advanced form of leisure, which I'm calling hyper leisure, that generates art technology and aid for other people. It's more productive than work, and it's more restful than leisure.

Work. It can't be more of both. I don't think so

dad. I think we're going to transition to a solar punk social ecological fully automated luxury degrowth society with a new utopian synthesis.

I don't see how that would be possible. I don't there's no specific things, they could make that happen. As far as I'm aware.

Oh, no specific things that can make that happen.

Yeah. Tough words. You heard your papa?

You think. I don't have a big list of specific things. I can make that happen. Papa,

of course you don't boy. Nobody does.

Oh yeah. You're super years. Real confident in that.

All right, aren't you dad?

See that, you're just stalling.

If we're clever, dad, we can have our cake and eat it too.

We'll use
- Agrovoltaics
- Phyto- and myco-remediation
- Modularity and interoperability
- Layered direct democracy
- Food forests
- Domed greenhouses
- Hempcrete
- Terra preta^[[Terra preta - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta)] soil

- Habitat restoration
- Total repair, complete recycling and the abolition of trash
- Democratic technological renaissance amplified by the abolition of patents and new platforms for democratic technological collaboration

A society that does more with less, daaaaaad, and ensures every human being a good life with without ecological offense. And that's just off the top of my head. It's called library socialism ecological luxury. Look it up. people your age get the internet, right...

What are you speechless? Hey, speechless dead. We're changing your name to speechless dad. I, I mean speechless, dad.

I'd have to google all of those things in those, And I'll see

I'm doing a dolphin style dance around you like wiggling back and forth.

Papa and boy.

Today's episode of seriously wrong is brought to you by electrified personal and mass public transit. As part of a layered usufructian, urban transportation strategy, which tears up the roads and turns the city into a lush living ecosystem. Cars are an inefficient in resource hungry, method of transportation and roads when combined with street-level parking take up anywhere between 30 to 60 percent of our city's surface area, that should all be ripped up and replaced with trees, plants, animals, and forests other buildings at an ecologically.

Luxurious society. This concrete blight on our living, space will be eliminated in favor of a combination of energy, efficient transportation systems that together and layered provide more convenience and luxury than the current unecological. Concrete transportation systems were used to Combination of underground subway train networks, along with above ground, trails made with permeable materials for smaller more personalized vehicles like bikes fellow mobiles, e-bikes cargo cycles and smaller electric vehicles. Similar to golf carts, we can create a fast, reliable energy, efficient transportation network. That is accessible to everyone regardless of their mobility needs external. Electrified power sources can reduce or eliminate the need for batteries in electrified public transit systems personal rapid transit can increase both convenience and efficiency by designing dynamically detachable train cars that can chain up and break off from one another as needed. To take people, more directly from one stop to another within a train system and reduce or eliminate stops between their starting point and destination, this more convenient than the trains of the current world, pedal bice a close, another human powered, transportation are elegant and luxurious pieces of engineering and used by many residents of the ecological city because of its unique synergistic health and ecological benefits and they can easily be circulated and maintained based on use of fructe and principles. The same is true of Chinese wheelbarrows are highly efficient form of human powered cargo transportation. Many types of transportation including but not limited to Chinese wheelbarrows can be augmented with sales which are deployable in the right conditions to harvest wind power^[[How to Downsize a Transport Network: The Chinese Wheelbarrow | LOW←TECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/12/how-to-downsize-a-transport-network-the-chinese-wheelbarrow/)]. making every neighborhood green and beautiful with abundant access to healthy food stores, library depots entertainment, functions community meeting places. And so, on combined, with normalizing remote, work options can reduce the need to travel on the first place.

An important part of making transportation sustainable is by making our transportation system, fit people's actual needs. Instead of the needs that happen to be manufactured by our current punishing work called culture. Our unecological society in the world that we have inherited.

Electrified transit system that is more convenient, more effective and more efficient than our current one in an ecological society. Electrified personal and mass public transit. As part of a layered, usify arcade in urban transportation strategy, which tears up the roads and turns the city into a lush living ecosystem, proud sponsor of today's episode.

I think one of the cultural shifts that would happen or that is part of ecological luxury is a culture of noticing where things are inefficient and being able to bring those to the attention of a society and the society that's committed to figuring out solutions for all of these things.

You know, it's kind of similar in a way to full recycling or full repair. It's like, I want to wait to fully capture all of the outstanding tasks that are necessary for like a climate transition for making things, more, energy, efficient, and kind of like crowdsourcing that. I don't know.

I keep thinking about in my building, I live in an old building, it has

they just turn it on in the winter and turn it off in the summer and I have no thermostat and so when it's warm in my apartment, I open my window and the radiator is right beside the window, so that prevents it from getting too warm in the apartment because I just let the heat go out the window. I'm always just like, oh, that's so horrible. But in order to fix that, this would need to be like, logged in society would need to be like, okay, we are going to fix this old building and prevent all this useless energy where pumping out into heating the outdoors, Installing more modern systems. This is just like one inefficiency that I noticed in my apartment because I'm in my apartment all the time. The world is full of these things and in an ecologically luxurious society, there's like a place where you can put this up and be like we should fix this thing and there's a place where people who want to help fixing, those things can help do that can be trained into doing that.

You know, like, the orientation of society is like, let's notice all these places where society is just inefficient in little, casual ways that aren't noticed or are noticed, but not by managers. And the, another part of this and he's like, workplace is often you notice things. We're just like, that's wasteful and stupid.

Why are we throwing this stuff out? When this food away when we could give it to people the day before it expires? But because of like corporate cultures and like it's never addressed. We're just going to continue totally produce food to be thrown out at grocery stores rather than giving it away because our society.

Figurative potential there. Like if you set up a place for people to notice waste in public and like have a public log especially where you start getting like reputations involved like that. That's your rental companies fucking up with your shit and they need to do an upgrade, right? There's no place to pressure them to do that.

Even if it's been noticed not just by you but by other people, right? So like yeah, in similarly like, imagine you're you're working at uh, these progressive companies. You know, you're lush cosmetics and your whole foods and the type of waste that goes unnoticed or the type of ways that goes notice but has nowhere to be logged.

It's really important. I think there's something there because their whole reputation like, especially where people's reputation, it should be kind of an everyone's reputation, but in particular, where people's reputation is caught up. I'm not wasting waste being noticed, maybe, uh, beneficial tactic a very non-aggressive tactic too. It's just literally looking at something in public being seen like almost like yelp or like glass door but for the ecologically, non-optimal processes. Yeah, I think i've be great, but it would also be great if like there was like uh the power of an institution behind it. Yeah, the power of an institution behind it and like if you were like, oh hey I want to like actually fix this thing. not that I'm against making employers pay for like if yeah we force employers to pay people to do it in a capitalist society that's great. But I also like the idea of it being like voluntary like people who want to fix these things god and fix them and like Yeah that's a little more the utopian yeah in the current dystopian society we got a force employers to pay for it.

Using the government in the utopian society it would be all volunteer and it would be like people who see these things like I want to fix that. You'd be able to like with society would enable that for you. But hey forcing employers to pay for it, providing jobs for people doing things that are helping the ecology, that's great.

I love that the concept of participatory ecological address engineering and efficiencies and yeah, designing for ecological luxury and having it be a participatory process. I think that's a really profound aspect of so like everyone has has less time at work as part of this transition too. And that time can be used obviously any way that people want to use it.

And that's the whole point of it. But one of the things that we might ask people to use that time for is two participate in thinking about the transition itself. And like we've talked a little bit about intellectual property and the opening up of the internet libraries, and how that makes everyone richer and experience and in ways that are hard to put into monetary terms because they're so large.

But another aspect of intellectual property and this transition is like the patent system development for profit affects, their innovations. And if something can't be made profitable, it might just be hidden away and not shared, it'd be much better to have a system where people are collaboratively participating in the development of things, without an incentive for, or even just a personal sense of ownership, over ideas. But instead of having a participatory Collective participation thing that, you know, experts obviously first and foremost would be engaging with necessarily. But anyone has the ability in some sense or another to participate in the process of witnessing this and giving feedback on it. And this is a democratic process that we've never Had it's a freedom we've never had in our existing life, but I think is really important because Even lay people often have insights into things like they're capable.

They don't have training but they they have the ability to make educated guesses or ask good questions or clarifying questions and so on. So finding the right methodology for that interface between cutting edge research, including design research, including technological research, And having access to all information in an open sense and also having a participatory aspect to it.

I think could really in the sense that the fully automated luxury communists, talk about unlock technological innovation, on a scale that capitalism has been unable to do because people will spend their free time to learn about this stuff and get passionate about it. Yeah, there's a lot of technological like sort of the tinkering impulse among people that is a hampered on purpose by the people currently designing our technology for like, intellectual property reasons.

The process of technological innovation is inherently fascinating to? Yeah, our minds. To hyper, focus on something. Try and figure out a problem and might be like, really get into the details on like some individual thing, I think like yeah, it would be a popular thing too. For focus energy on exactly the type of people who would be into this. This is like their ultimate utopia. So I'm, I'm telling you right now, we're trying to design your ultimate utopia where you can get your eyes in there. You can think about the cutting edge shit, you can leave a comment and be part of it and end you have access to the education and training and etc that it would take to move upwards to become an expert yourself. That door is always open to everyone. Yeah, all these people whose now hyper focus is being forced by companies until like designing DRM software or whatever would be instead unleash on the process of like environmentally optimizing society. For the most amount of luxury for the least amount of ecological impact, or for the most ecological harmony at the same time, I think that effect what this sort of open information, participatory culture around innovation and technology and like making it a publicly shared and participatory project, it would create a technological Renaissance would create a Tears of luxury and ecology.

Yeah, I mean if that's the research focus too, it's like we're looking for this principle to effectively create luxury while meeting environmental limits. We're looking to create a good life for everyone. Create the most advanced technology possible while using sustainable practices materials and so on and developing new ways to do that.

There's just huge frontiers of what it's possible. And I think just at this point is necessary, like, there's a lot of Technology. We have that we could deploy. Now that would be very helpful in mitigating the climate situation that we've inherited, but there's also things that we need to do that.

We don't know how to do yet. Yeah. And weird thing because like there's a sort of capitalist techno optimism that, you know, this constantly like right around the corner things are being promised that are going to like make things revolutionarily better for the customer only. If you buy our product or if you invest in our company or whatever.

There's like we can't limit the production of new technology. We're going to miss out on the metaverse revolution next year. And if we go a year without releasing new new hardware, we will be totally fucked when it comes to virtual reality. God, if we the metaverse, I feel like really just does need to be put on pause.

Like I'm not saying we could never build a metaverse.

Should we put the metaverse on pause until we figure out the ecological crisis situation, and then maybe have the stats on, how much? Resources are being put towards, yeah. Development of this metaversity. Yeah, the thing I was going to say the difference between that sort of, like, advertising copy techno optimism where they're like, lying to you about what their technology is capable of because they want investment money or they want customers.

It's just like a completely different thing than actually allowing the people who are Thinking through these problems who are engineers, who are like, noticing and efficiencies or thinking of creative ways to address and efficiencies, the technological engineering, scientific intellectual might of the human race is all being directed towards the goal of making profit rather than the goal of ecological luxury.

So like it's not some naive, techno optimistic thing to say that if we put human creativity and intellect towards this problem, that we will find new frontiers of ecologically, luxurious technology, and systems, and ways of doing things and working together. Like that's just When humans put our minds to things, we come up with novel solutions, creative solutions and we make progress towards things capitalist techno optimism is laughable because it's not their true goal. Most of the time to actually make people's lives better. It's like to make profit for themselves. So I think we could have a real technological renaissance if we democratize the development of technology, through the abolition of pens and collaborative platforms, that give people access to information.

I think people want to help, but we just have to get out of their way. Provide platforms and avenues, and opportunities for the people who are already want to help to help. Yeah, it's kind of sad when you think of all the wasted energy and potential out there in terms of people who want to be part of the solution who would love to be involved in development implementation and thinking about these big problems that we face as a species and thinking about the technology that we need to make our lives better.

And they're

Only show that interviews, various possible contingent futures to see what is in store for humanity's future this week. We are looking at various futures where humanity is tried to implement ecological luxury. We're excited to find out whether these experiments have turned into future utopias or dystopias. Usually, on the show, we get a healthy mix of both.

First stop: Universe A, we got you on the line.

Hello. Hello. I love this show goodbye.
Oh great. Can you tell us about your future ecologically and our dometopia?

We use domestopia, we have an ecological dometopia. I would say to protect from climate events. We have enormous domes that go over entire cities and we climate control, we have tropical environments, even in cold places and stuff.

We've lived in domes for hundreds of years at this point actually.

Wow, that does sound really cool. Is that because of the tensile strength of domes

the you got it, bucky buckminster Fully, he's out of your history.

He's on our money here which is tied to an energy standard.

Oh really fascinating.

Domes can cover larger areas with less materials, more efficiency and stuff. The dome corps are our number one employer. I work for the dome corps myself. You make domes yeah and repair I would say I'm a dome expert, but pretty much everyone you talk to is a dome expert around here and uh

what powers your domes

we use fossil fuels but we use only one thimble full of gasoline for an entire life cycle for an engine is all it takes because it's so efficient. And then you have a full capture system. So the carbon capture happens inside the car and then a brick of carbon, sort of laid like an egg, every 200 thousand miles, but the cars can go in water or they can fly like planes as well.

And just it's the same as the same vehicle.

Yeah. It's the same as driving to us. We don't even, it's like changing gears. If you're in the back seat, you wouldn't even look up from your book.

Wow, that sounds fun. I would love to visit your reality someday.

Yeah, there's a perfect cycle where we capture all pollution and you know, pollution is just materials that you aren't capturing and using.

So is every building in your society dome.

Yes. Sometimes we have domes within domes and very rarely and but occasionally we have a dome within a dome within a dome. People are saying, there might even be four layers of domes in some places in the near future, which I thought I don'ts, I hope I honestly hope for it because domes, they have got a lot of tensile strength, they use less materials.

Like I'm a big fan of domes. I'm gonna just saying that because we have domes on the other side of the money. I mean, we vote on this stuff, we vote by telephone

Democratically, that domes are the way. I mean, some people vote against domes. I don't know why they act out that way, but I guess when something has become so normal, it's in the background, like, domes are to us, you'd have to have a good reason to challenge it, and that doesn't show up.

Do you have domes in in your world?

A few, not a lot.

Oh, bro,

most buildings are kind of rectangles or what's a three-dimensional rectangle called, yeah.

Yeah. No. I don't have some ugly shape. I mean, we have some decent looking buildings. I mean, I do love domes and I love the idea of the dome over the city.

Anyway, we are out of time. Thank you so much for sharing your future world and you would say to utopia it sounds pretty utopian. Yeah, it's great. Thank you so much.

Well, that was fascinating what? Uh, banging way to start the show. I'm excited.

Let's dive right into universe B and we will hope for another ecological luxury utopia. Let's find out!

Hello, can you hear me?
Hello.
Hey, good to see you.
Good to see you too.
Thank you for coming on the show and tell us about your possible future. It's a possible future for us, real present for you.

Some of the things that we do. We pause energy once a week. First we turned off all the energy that wasn't necessary for one day a week. We had a variety of clubs and stuff like that but we lived a low energy lifestyle for just one day a week and that helped us identify in the system, it made us capable of pausing, which is really useful. And we've kept up that tradition of pausing one day a week just to do non-electric things. I like it. It makes budgeting our energy on the other days a lot easier

fascinating.

And obviously, while the sun has gone, we do nighttime rationing, we don't have a lot of battery capacity, but that's by choice.

It's this is a fun way to live and you have enough food and energy, everything kind of you need to live or just kind of a 100% tons of abundant fresh food, great cooking. A lot of free time, we barely work it all and everything is basically made out of wood.

Oh that sounds great.

Yeah. What do you mean by a lot of wood just like stuff that we 

wood is what is like 50 percent carbon and we needed to capture lots of carbon so we invested sort of our technological focus on finding new ways to preserve wood for the long term.

So you have sort of a library socialist type society and you make a lot of things out of wood to store carbon in the wood of the things that you're building to last a really long time and we just like, would you know what is this? Nice strong material. Here's my wooden laptop. It's a laptop computer.

Yeah and was that sufficient to pull carbon out of your atmosphere just put it into items that you made or oh yeah. 

Nowhere near something people write about is like eventually it does break down. So right, we've been investing in other ways to change the carbon balance but it's like temporary measure like temporary in terms of thousands of years and taking a fraction of the total carbon.

But we'll take what we can get.

the universe I was just talking to sound kind of similar to yours. I actually they had a lot of domes in there's though.

It. Go watch my words, I'll be polite but I think the sick Domist ideology was defeated pretty definitively in The Great War.

Domists. Yeah, I don't know about the history of your your world but

clearly not.

Is there anything else? Interesting, you tell me about you

when I was a kid, you know like a lot of kids I wanted to be an astronaut but as I got older, I realized a certain dignity and being a scuba diver. And the sunken cities looking for salvageable materials, like my parents did before me, so you have astronauts in your society.

Oh yeah, you were mentioning low tech options I didn't lots of wood to, you know, obviously you're not gonna build spaceships out of wood but no. Yeah, we don't use only what. Yeah, we didn't space, we have like a space colony, uh, nine million people live on the moon, really successful. I mean, it's all done with environmental limits, of course.

And we built shit out of wood up there, too. Like, if you go inside the oh, you have like a dome up there. That where you build? No, oh sorry. I just in space. I thought maybe you used, no, we don't have dogs. I forgot.

Like a rectangle but it's three-dimensional. Yeah, yeah, I love that shape. Glad to hear that, and it's not made out of what we have. A fleet of asteroid mining robots that bring down rare earth minerals to the moon base and then later down to earth. So we have a pretty sustainable supply of ability to build up, our tech capacity.

This sounds like a fascinating world, a bit of a strange of version to domes, but, you know, pretty utopian. Overall, thank you so much for coming on. All right, well, let's move right on to university and wait. Uh, Not again, you didn't. Just yeah, I know you're right. You're right.

Okay, bye.

Jerry, I got to go, I can't finish the episode family. Emergency at home. We gonna do it without you. My cat is stuck behind the sofa again so I got to go if someone else tries to get mr. Whiskers out, they're just gonna scare him further into the sofa.

Yeah, you know, the drill cherry. It's, I'm the only one who can get him out. He doesn't trust anyone else. I just it's better. I deal with it now. Were looking for your big break. The kids gonna do it. You can do it kids. He's always wanted. There's a shot, everyone, the kid.

Hi everyone. There are first host has unfortunately had to deal with a cat related incident. Next up, we'll be calling universe C. Hello universe C, You're on the line.

Hey possibility watch

anything you want to share us about your ecological luxury and universe?

Yeah, first thing I want to say is that our entire society is kind of like self-organized pods. So we call them social, modules of people who've organized online to perform specific tasks, or to work together on different things. And they sort of confederate together through this online app. Ecosystem to vote on larger projects but they can also break off and split off. You know, you form online pods with anyone and you start doing democracy together, connect everyone else doing democracy together, bing bang, boom! You got a global democracy. It's beautiful. It's bottom up. Real tech inspired to sort of democratic foundation of our society. How is this ecological? And what way is this ecological exposure? It's so ecological, if one of the first things we did with set up an app, where people don't donate all their stuff to the commoning institution of society and then you can use the app to take stuff out.

So you're society is a library economy as well.

Yeah, I would definitely classify as a library economy, all through the, the library app. One of the things that made the biggest difference in our society was it kind of started as a job's guarantee under the old political system with a kind of gig economy twist where people could report inefficiencies in.

So,

Recoding software to eliminate bloat. The accessibility database is a big part of this too. People say, hey, this building could be made more accessible if we wide in the doorways. Hey, there should be different lighting options in this public space here and people, you know, do the work to implement, the technological solutions to those problems.

After their noticed, put into the system, and then people can fix the problems that need to be fixed. And then you'd get paid in the old system to take care of it and the gig economy thing. Nowadays, you don't really get paid to do it. It's more like there's, you know, leaderboards, you can get treats, or sometimes you can jump in the library queue.

There's a whole bunch of sort of algorithmic tweaks. We've made to, you know, make it fun to keep contributing, but mostly people just want to contribute because it's satisfying, right? You open up the app, you say oh hey this building a few blocks away from me. Needs some like upgrades to its heating system.

I know how to do that. I've done courses on that at the local maker space slash workshops slash teaching each other how to do. So it's all very voluntary. It's individuals doing what they want to do is ecological. It's it's a beautiful. It's the last universe, we were speaking to on the program and formed us that they had a very large scale and active space program.

What state is your space program in sorry space program. No did 

you don't know about the history of our society, the beloved twins who perished in space, familiar with us? Arrogance of man to leave the planet. Could you explain for our listeners beloved twins? Who were they? What happened back in the day?

There was a pod. Who tried to create space travel every day. Space travel, they called it. They've been blogging. The whole thing for years. People got to know and love this family. This pod of people and the two cute little twins. The the darling little twins that we all loved.

They did there made in voyage. Let me say that live stream with And burned in the shuttle, it traumatized, all of us and since then, we've all just agreed to not pursue that we anyone who suggests space travel in this society gets voted down immediately. You get spammed with pictures of the twins and I think rightly.

So space travel is dangerous, pointless, we don't need it. We have what we need here on the planet. We can live ecologically within the boundaries of what's available here and we don't need to see any more dead twins. I'm so sorry for what you and your people went through.

They just had so much life ahead of them. I would say that people of our world stand with you in your twins. Thank you for saying that that's all the time we have for this call. So thank you for joining us from universe C best to you in yours and rest in peace to the twins.

Universe D, Are you on the line?
Hey hi. How's it going? My name is Jimony earthling. I am capitalist thomas. Well, it's very nice to meet you. Thanks for being on the show. What can you tell us about your world? Well we are big on private property here. Yeah, we put it ahead of everything else including ecology, especially ecology.

There's a system technically where you can like offset damage, you do using elaborate sort of points and what it amounts to is. You can do whatever you want. As long as you're wealthy, we sort of put carbon in the atmosphere indefinitely and an accelerating rate and we pretend that we care and like, oh, we're going to stop it down.

We go to stop it, but then we don't and then we just blame the powerless people and say, like, oh, you bought the wrong things, you idiot, you know, and I mean them with a newspaper to be fair to us. They did buy the wrong things. Yeah, that's yeah.

I mean they had the choice, it's kind of true. So what else is our society? Like we met, we manufacture things actually to break easily because you make more money. That way, when things break easily you throw them out, and then you buy another one. And it's like, way more efficient in terms of maximizing, the amount of money that you make.

Yeah. And the money is needed to incentivize people to make high quality products. So you're kind of in a bind and then we just

It doesn't exist, create a landfill. Maybe we'll throw the garbage into space at some point and turn space into our trash can. Yeah, there we good. Next step, long-term plan. Also, there's a lot of scientists in our society, that, you know, they're kind of annoying and they're always giving these dire warnings, like, oh, we're crossing yet another critical.

Boundary in the road to climate change and we're like, okay we get it. It's dire. Yeah, they keep warning us, I'm warning us. And we're like, okay, we get it. I all right. If you're warning me now, why'd you warn me before? Yeah, great. It hasn't gone that much worse.

If you look over here in my closet, actually, this might be fun for your audience. I'll just open the door here over here, and you'll see kind of comically large amount of stupid crap that I purchased once, and never really used again, but it was manufactured from raw materials.

And I just keep it in my closet here, sort of like, I'm too lazy to sell it and you feel guilty, so you just carry it with you, you move a few times. Eventually a little piece snaps off, you're like oh thank god, I can throw this thing out.

Yeah, it's technically We broke. Can you send it to the dump? And then you can buy a new one to put in your closet? I mean, it's cheaper than fixing it. Anyways, I mean, this is a, yeah, this is a. Yeah, what do you think of our great utopia?

That's pretty amazing right better than most universes. Am I right? This is deeply disturbing stuff. What you've described here. It's bizarre, your worship of private property to distorts everything. Okay. Properties essentialed innovation. I thought this was supposed to be, uh, ecological luxury universe. It doesn't even sound like you attempted ecological luxury.

Oh yeah. No, we do. This is we actually run a company called ecological luxury. Yeah, it's got basically a monopoly. It's like ecological luxury. It's our big company, and it's sort of runs the whole world. It's like our big centralized distro. Everyone works for them and like, right? Yeah, we have it on the flag.

There's no nation states. We just have it on the flag directly from the corporation and ICA. They're truly evil. Right. Well, I mean, you're not allowed to criticize them or you'll lose your job, so i, I love them myself. I love them too, but it's, that's why I say, my company I think of them is mine.

It's like we, my company. It's like it's like we're the every worker is an owner. Yeah. And a metaphorical sense. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm a very literal sense as owned by someone else, right? But in a metaphorical sense, it's like a family which is a good because they separate us from our families family, time is not work time.

It's

We're all at a time, I We're all at a time. Goodbye. I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this. Oh, come on kid. You did a great job. Hey, let's at random applause. It was a great. Great co-host. That you got a rough one kid. That's it's not usually like that.

Do you need to talk to a counselor? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, some people are just so In their own society. They don't even see how horrible it is. Those are always the toughest ones.

- - -

I think the fully automated luxury communists are right about the appeal of leisure and automation and the appeal of technology for helping ferment. A mass political consciousness towards new egalitarian, political frontiers. But I also, I want to argue for the automation of the pedal bike. I want the bicycle is a beautiful example of automation.

There's something elegant and automated enough about a door that locks that and like keys, doorknobs and hinges. It's automated in a way compared to cutting a hole in the wall and then patching it up every time or something like that. And like, a non-electric door is kind of automated in the way that an automatic door that opens for you.

When you walk up to it needs to be powered by energy, which comes from somewhere, but that process is totally automated with a mechanical door or like a bicycle of an amplification of human capacity to be able to move fast faster with less energy and less effort. And so it's sort of a type of automation, that increases leisure and

Lock locking a door. Rather than like, standing in front of the door and holding it. Shut, a hammer is an automated thing when compared to trying to push in a nail with your thumb, the automatic door example is a bit harder for me to wrap my head around, but if we're talking about automation as the process of making it so that certain human actions, no longer need to be taken because the technology makes them obsolete with Automatic door, you have to like, hook it up to electricity, you have to make sure there's a power grid, you have to make sure all the mechanical parts are operating properly.

You know, it might break down a lot more easily than a sort of standard non-automatic door. There's a lot of extra things you have to do for an automatic door that you don't have to do for a manual door. So in that sense. Yeah, like a manual, like it's kind of the powering of.

It isn't fully automatic because a human has to take the action to open it, but no human has to take the action of hooking it up to a paragrade and powering it. Like yeah, like doing all that stuff. It's a, it's a mind twisty version of it, but yeah, in general, I agree that, like, all or most technology is a type of automation.

There's something really beautiful about giving different options. Yeah, I don't, maybe I'm crazy for thinking this, but I would just, I would love to have the option to like manually open and close a garage door, alongside the automated

Is appealing to me. But like the tactileness, the connectedness to the mechanics of it. And like I want to argue for full automation but also in the context of like full tactile mechanical, you know, like hands-on automation yes but the world needs to also stay hands-on. The world needs to get more hands on the weird thing about the phrase fully automated like you're fully gives this idea of like you never have to touch anything.

You never have to turn a crank or pedal your own bike. Or do you like just shrink down to nothing? We'll just Bodysuit and you'll know they'll walk for you and like AI will decide what you were gonna say and put on your hover backpack and you'll be dragged around with your toes, scraping the ground.

Like I think that level of full automation there's a sort of is a straw man. Yeah but not not even that even like that apple store future like there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes of like that kind of thing to always like fix the bluetooth things and like I think like we've used the phrase sufficient automation before what types of sufficient automation will be different for different people.

Some people really will want all doors to just open up for them because opening doors is difficult other people like yeah, like usually I just like open a door and that's great. Having like different options or just having things automated enough to wear the bulk of the horribleness is gone.

Like, having a washing machine is great. Having a washing machine that folded all my laundry for me? Honestly, I would probably accept that level of like an upgrade on level of

And collect all the clothes and then like, fill my dresser again for maybe we could invent that but i, yeah, there's like a level of automation and it's like, different for different things and we already have that like, you know, people haven't gotten rid of whisks just because you have electric mixers for some things like a hand whisk is just more convenient.

Yeah. Like the cranks and things you're talking about. That reminds me like steampunky vibe. That's what I think of. I know it sounds weird to be like, oh this is utopian. I wish there was more utopian cranks and I wish more. I wish my blender was manual but yeah.

Genuinely I think, I mean, like, it's ideal to have both. I think it's ideal to have both and have norms towards contributing energy when you can and like, valuing that human energy because there's also synergistic like it's a benefit if I save battery power. So this is assuming an environment where we don't have like, you know, exceptional energy abundance, which I don't rule out that there could just one day be so much energy that we don't know what to do with all of it.

Yeah, we just figure out fus.

100% no matter how much you use it. Yeah, there's something synergetic between saving energy by providing energy and the way that your body is positively impacted by engaging and like active movement, I think there's a real value to tactile things in life being hands-on to feeling the textures of different things.

Yeah, to write on paper and not always write on screen, you know, the feeling of a typewriter or even a mechanical keyboard compared to like a touch screen keyboard. I hate touch buttons on things so this is just like a small thing, but like give me a fucking real button.

Yeah, i've Earbuds that i've purchased a few times and they recently upgraded them to be touched things. So now, every time I take them in and out of my ear, it pauses, it's just like I literally had to go buy new earbuds just because it made me so angry to use to touch your button, the main criteria.

I use to find new earbuds was has a real button on it, rather than most of them don't, I went to the library today and I wrote the sky train and I had to load up my transit card with a touch screen, right? And it kept not registering my button press or registering slightly to the left of where it should be and like the screen's dirty and shit too.

And it's like, yeah, give me a fucking mechanical button that I can press. That's like refill card beep. If the one screen experience I could have when buying tickets from machines and shit was like an LED text screen that would send one little message at a time that's directly relevant.

No, pop-ups of like, oh, it's transit week. No, pop-ups. Like, fucking

Resident and feel the click. That what you said? Really resonated with me there. Touch screens have their place? They're great. I'm glad we invented them. I like the touch screen on my smartphone. Every other touch screen that exists should go away parking things, or like I bought a kitchen scale that has touch buttons, and if I drip water on it, it presses the button.

Table. No, it's you're so right. And it's such a great example of yeah, where steampunk is better than apple store. Yeah, and just yeah, and and how ecological luxury as a political movement appreciates, both the leisure of automation and the tactileness of really participating in the world. Not looking in through glass, We now go to a guy meeting his friend down at the crank for a drink.

Gate gate, ready? Good to see you. I already come in. Oh no problem. I ordered you your big monte. You know, me so well. So, do you want to position yourself on this side of the giant turning crank that goes down to the basement to generate electricity and I'll go over here?

Yeah, sure. Let me just double check. Some of the pads are worn off on the crank and I was like to choose one of the pedals that have nice padding on it. But yeah, let's let's position ourselves and start turning this crank, all right? Yeah, once we get it going, we can keep it going up, a little easier.

Yeah, yeah. It's just that initial. There we go. Especially designed this where we can look at each other while we're turning this big prank. Yeah, what a feet of engineering. That's an important part of social cranking, being able to look your friends. In the eyes. I'm glad to get the exercise too.

So it's oh, I wouldn't usually comment on how great this design is, you know, because it's so normal to us, we do this all the time. Yeah, but yes. Sometimes it's important to stop and smell the roses and appreciate things that are extremely normal in your life. But amazing.

Nonetheless ego boys to your momantas on the house as usual because we live in a cash free society. Thank you, it's wild to think that there was ever a time before people would enjoy beverages together socially down at the crank. Yeah you said it man this is weird to think people actually live in their whole lives without doing this and like what are they're just sitting there they're just contorting their body into a little.

Yeah, sitting position like who wants to sit for that? What about their spines? Yeah. I mean like I don't mind to sit as a

With another friend. Yeah, it's perfect. Time to do the crank a little, for some social cranking. Yeah. It feels good. And it helps everyone like sometimes when I I'm walking down the street and I walk by a cafe and I look in the, I look in the window and see everyone cracking with their friends, then I feel taken care of in a way.

Absolutely. And you know, I think the tea just tastes sweeter when the energy to heat, it was cranked out right there locally. Fresh, I mean, local cranked energy is more efficient. Yeah, no need to send it across the country. You can crank it right there. I mean, let's just the way, I was raised cranking starts on the home.

Yeah. What happened to good old-fashioned cranking family values. That's what I say. And that was a guy meeting his friend down at the crank. And now, back to our show,

Hey there, cool cats. Welcome to eco-tech jazz corner. The only smooth jazz radio show. That brings you ecological technologies each and every week and how was your week? Oh I'm doing positively ecological, thank you for asking, how about yourself ecological as well. Also technological, smooth, technological, weekend, ecological and technological, or that goes together, like peanut butter and jelly.

That goes together, like, saxophone and drums. I like to think of it. Like, the ecology is the salt and technology is the pepper and then the jazz. Is that delicious umami flavor on top? Let's get into the eco-technology. Yeah, so solar electricity is increasingly cheap to produce, and is a major source of energy for future ecological luxury.

But a large amount of available energy is not captured and converted further. Energy is lost in our systems by converting that energy into To inefficiencies, reduce the viability of solar to meet our needs overall, but there is an alternative solar thermal energy capturing, the heat of the sun directly and deploying it towards the ends of heating up.

What needs to be heated up when the sunlight is available? As part of an energy? Mix that provides for everyone without ecological offense, solar thermal is indispensable passive building design, can create ultra low energy, buildings that utilize combinations of solar gain windows, super insulation, heat recovery air exchangers hot water recovery thermal collectors and other building designed techniques to store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and to reject solar heat in the summer, to create buildings that use very little energy for heating or cooling.

Of a functioning compost gets warm a, john pain system is a coiled pipe full of water which can utilize the heat energy of composting to heat water tanks houses and other similar heating uses. Sodium ion batteries can be made from materials far more abundant and accessible than lithium ion batteries, but our excess renewable.

Electricity can also be stored and deployed in various ways that are not typical batteries made from mind materials. Electricity can be used to pump water, back and forth in tanks or natural bodies of water like lakes using gravity and hydropower. As a means to store energy. Energy can also be stored as heat in sand as compressed air or stored through other mechanical mechanisms that can later be deployed at will power to gas, can convert excess electricity to hydrogen, which can be stored transported and used on demand the 17th century technology.

The trump is a simple device with no moving parts that turns the movement of flowing water and streams or rivers and turns it into compressed air, any place where we have flowing water, we can produce compressed air tanks, that can function. Friends or generate electricity by preserving 10 percent of crop lands for rewilding efforts, you can reduce soil laws by 95 percent phosphorous, loss, by 90 percent and nitrogen loss by 85 percent increasing soil quality and preventing groundwater contamination, this practice, which is called prairie, strips increases biodiversity and provides habitat for important bird and insect populations that help control pests and act as pollinators.

Fuller, advocated for dome based construction because domes have a few beneficial structural properties for doing more with less. Firstly, the structurally efficient and require less materials to make a stronger structure, resilient against external forces in most construction. A higher level of redundant checks and balances are used to protect the integrity of a structure.

But domes have an efficient load distribution that can have the same integrity with less materials. Fuller, noted that domes integrity is the result of the internal tension of the dome which he titled. 10 segreity domes also have less surface area than alternative structures and as a result save on energy for heating and cooling in extreme environment's, domes can even be put over entire villages for efficient.

Climate control in cold or dry conditions, electric velocmobiles are a type of aerodynamic weather protected personal bike, which optimizes ergonomics, and aerodynamics for maximum efficiency. And when electrified can travel

They utilize electricity for acceleration and steady pedaling from the user to maintain speed. If we converted all US work commutes from car trips to vellamobile trips, it would take only one quarter of existing US, wind energy infrastructure to power them. If these same trips were taken in an electric car, it would take 20 times.

The current US wind infrastructure. Human powered inputs, like pedals and cranks have a larger role to play in an integrated energy. Mix, many tools, like blenders and garage doors. Can easily be powered directly by humans in the vast majority of cases. If we set up the modular infrastructure to alternate between electricity use in human power at well, for example, in many gyms you have rows of exercise by its dispersing, human energy into the ether, while at the same time, coal power televisions, play the news for the people on the bikes that inefficiency can be easily.

Patched, most gym equipment could be redesigned to capture the wasted energy of human workouts and it's also possible to integrate To feed back into the energy grid. The same way solar power does. If we had people's already existing exertion and exercise feed into available energy on the grid we can do more with less and have a more ecological and luxurious society.

That is some sweet ecological technology. Oh yeah. You know the way that you tap your toe to some good jazz when you're having a good time. Yep. I feel that way about these ideas. I'm sort of tapping my idea toe to these ideas beat. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm picking up what's being put down here?

This is something very smooth. Luxurious. Sometimes I imagine a world where the whole world is tapping. Their feet to that beat that ecological technology. Be what we could accomplish, sometimes jazz is about the notes, you don't play and sometimes ecological technology is about the technologies. You don't use

Yeah, I think there's a lot of potential in technology like we're talking about techno optimism and how I think the response to that is like a lot of, well, warranted skepticism about specific claims made of what's possible but like something that gets lost in that response to corporate techno-optimism is just the fact that if you look at the history of technology and even just the technology that we currently have some times technology, not only does everything it promised, it could do, it does way more and does really amazing cool things that you would never have dreamed possible.

Even just living in a society with mostly horse drawn carriages or coal, powered trains imagining the current level of transportation technology and like vehicles, and cars. And there's problems with a lot of technology and a lot of the advances come with concerns for the environment and like, how they're designed and whether they're designed to work within the Sure.

But even within working within the bounds of the system of nature, there's a lot that we already know we can do. And I think the frontiers of what's possible is basically only as limited as our imagination is checkology really does. Fundamentally reshape human life over time and you can consider what's possible.

Now the fact that you're listening to this right now as someone who isn't local to Aaron's living room here in vancouver, British Columbia canada where we record the podcast. Yeah it's a surprisingly recent innovation. Yeah nothing even like this was close to possible until like the radio but then even then that was like a you needed like a whole radio tower to do radio and like the sketch isn't stuff.

We do the sound effects and music that we get from libraries back in the early age of radio, this would be like a high budget production, but we can just do it ourselves. Basically, the 1980s it would be like you'd have to pay for editors to

Like re-recor at like putting together a radio play production on this level, with just two people on the staff, as we've done. For 10 years, probably started to be possible. When we were 13 years within the decade. Before we, we started doing it. I guess, on a more general point on technology technology isn't just cool and it's not just interesting how it reshapes our lives for many people, technology, fundamentally makes their lives, a measureably better in ways that we take for granted, for example, glasses.

It's something we figured out as people, how to make these glass panes that help people see, and it's life changing. It means they can drive cars. It means they can. Yeah, such a weird, like, you can just show someone a series of increasingly smaller letters and ask them how blurry they are, and look in their eye, with the light and figure, okay?

This is what type of shape. The glass needs to be cut into to bend the light. It's amazing. Like it is really, really cool but it's also,

It's life-changing for all of us to live in a world where, you know, our neighbors friends, family, who need glasses are able to see and participate fully like, it makes people who need glasses free or in a way but it also makes us all free or in a way.

There's a lot of things that we take for granted in our life that are completely mediated by technology that we would not want to lose including an especially the information communication technology that we have now, with the ability to send information and files and communications all around the world and be connected across geographic barriers again, very, very recent.

We're in the early stages. The early decades of this being the social reality for human beings and I'm still ultimately an optimist about what that means for or species. No. Yeah, me too. Yeah, yeah. I think it's easy to slip into some of the like more critical views on the internet and like it's given us a lot of new potential but it's also created new problems which I think we should anticipate with

And challenges that come with it but I think like, yeah, I'm also a tech. No optimist at heart. I was thinking about AI recently and like we did a two part episode on AI and we were very critical of it or at least critical of a lot of the claims being made about it, and We did talk a little bit about how AI is cool in that episode, but I feel like maybe gave it a bit of short shift and like there's a lot of really interesting potential for AI technologies.

Like, for machine learning that things that were calling AI currently specifically. If we're talking about fully automated luxury communism, I think AI helping with automation, it seems really likely to me that it would be really good at that kind of thing because we were talking about how machine learning can't like, go beyond.

It's programming to do creative things. Or it's only good at very specific tasks or like, doing what you prompt it to do, but that's perfect for automating drudgerous. Labor that people don't want to be doing. Anyway, people already use a tod automate shit that they don't want to do.

Like people whose job it is to write check GPT like corporate speak text for things. I've talked to people being like this is like, liberated me from so much work at my job already. So like

Are able to like I saw this video of a robot sorting these blocks and it like kind of dropped one and I landed side, right? The seeing it sort these blocks into two different piles by color and noticing when one dropped and then being able to pick it up and put it so that it wasn't on its side anymore.

I was like, yeah, fuck. Yeah. The use of machine learning for like adaptive sorting of materials is potentially. I think a liberatory thing like we've talked before, on the show, about how a lot of problems with, like, waste in our society or actually like sorting problems things are ending up in the dump, that should actually be getting recycled and under capitalism, everything is in the wrong place.

And under library socialism, everything should be in the right place, right? So, if machine learning can do that successfully then that's great. Because, like, we need to like microplastics. For example, are a problem of sorting. There's all these little pieces of plastic, which are sorted into the wrong place, like, inside the soft tissue of our brain.

For example, so,

Brain. Yeah, so is machine learning sufficient to do all sorting things for us? I don't think so. But I think potentially machine learning NAI could be part of sorting in certain environments. Yes, sorting through dumps would not be a fun job if we can have like robots, do that using some type of machine learning?

That would be awesome. Yeah, and if we want to get like tech utopian about it. This kind of like dangerous scary version versions of this too, but sorting nanobots Sort of like technological frontier to think about. Yeah, if I think about nanobots flying into my brain to control my brain from some level enforce, I hate that, but if I'm thinking of nanobots flying into my brain, to remove microplastics increase, blood flow, you know, like make it so that I feel like really focused and like on the mark or something, that would be awesome.

Like a medical robot that can go in your body and like, scan. Oh yes. Removing brain cancer. When it goes in there. I would I be like get those nanobots in. Yeah. Like put this yeah, put those nanobots inside of my body if you're going to be able to scrape the brain, cancer out of my brain.

Yeah. Thank you. Good. Yeah. Where can I sign the more powerful? A technology is. The more burden of proof, I think is required before they can never be deployed to, like, so that we know they're not being used for nefarious. And yeah, i'd say I'm broadly in favor of brain cancer fighting nanobots.

If there is such a path that arises, yeah, me too at the same time, developing powerful technologies, also necessitates developing defenses against the potential misuse of those technologies. Yeah powerful democratic social structures that give people a say and the development and deployment of the technologies To be excited about they're excited about because they're potentially liberatory, one of the ones that I always it's got a space in my heart is vertical farms and like food towers.

Yeah, there's something really elegant and like being like oh it's you know condensed space-wise you can just like grow all this food like right there, it's local, you know, be close by be like less shipping less of a footprint you can rewild more. Yeah more nature for the animals and we can just build our own little like food ecosystems.

And like we're going out there into the countryside where we're taking these ecosystems of a bunch of different types of things. And and then we're reducing it to a monocrop because we want corn. And then we're just growing our corn there. They expense of everything else and it's like well you could just build your own corn to our and just fill it up as much corn as you want or yeah.

I don't know that vertical towers necessarily be mono crops but at the very least, if you did do them mono crop, it wouldn't be at the expense of an ecology, right? Yeah. It's more contained. It's yeah. See. Yeah. That's

The technological Renaissance with all of you in the democratic techno revolution. Yeah, there's a lot of like, I think good critiques of like, existing ideas for these towers and like, obviously we shouldn't implement them globally until they're proven to be ecological and like viable. But, yeah, I think I think it's something we should definitely keep working on because it's like if we can figure that out the liberatory potential and the ecological potential is really really high.

And like as far as I understand, it's like mostly like an energy issue at this point, like efficiency and that's like the kind of thing. You can keep iterating on and creating better versions of until you've passed the threshold where it's viable. We've mentioned it earlier in the episode but I'm also a fan of asteroid mining.

Just the concept of it is just like cool. We shouldn't treat space like a garbage can like I know it seems big but like the stuff that we put in space is going to persist in the orbits of things here. This is just a side point. I want to make there was a time when the ocean seemed infinite and we just threw garbage in it and then eventually we

Steak. I think there is going to be a day when we're like, actually it turns out that even though space is really big, we can't treat spaces a big garbage can but I was inspired when I read the book fully automated luxury communism by Aaron bastiani, what are the things that he mentioned in that book where I was like, now we're cooking.

This is interesting he's talking about a fleet of automated mining robots that self-fuel on hydrogen that's found on the asteroids that they're mining and it just opened up this realm of like that's really cool. Like yeah, maybe it's not feasible, maybe you know, like obviously there's maybe some more important things in the world and the short term definitely but at the same time like why shut the door to that like why?

I think having a critical perspective on the promises of tech is good but at the same time like that science fiction kind of utopian spirit is is a nourishing thing for political action. And for thinking about the world, we want to create and I think there is a world that I would be interested in being that includes asteroid mining for like rare earth minerals to make more.

Space travel is expensive in terms of energy and maybe we need like space elevators or like I said with food towers, there's going to need to be iterations before this technology is viable but there's something conceptually about asteroid mining that I really like which is that mining on earth has a lot of like really big downsides in terms of like damage to these surrounding ecology and asteroids they're just like big rocks and if we can go out to the big rocks and get like the metals and stuff that we need rather than digging around in our ecologies, on our planet to do that, there's something like really elegant and it feels like deeply ecological about that.

Again we have to iterate past the energy concerns and like, you know, fossil feel like we can't just go to space a bunch right now and do that, but like the idea that it's just like inherently bad or we shouldn't be looking too space is uh, Really ecological and give us like a greater pool of resources to Thrive with so yeah, I really like asteroid mining too.

On the subject of energy and it's also kind of connected to using more with less, but it's something that requires I think a technological renaissance and a serious development trajectory, but there was like this proof of concept of when people step down, they're like body weight pushes on this cement or the floor and it creates force and that force can be captured as energy.

They were able to like power the lights of a hallway from people walking down the hallway. So it's like a small amount of energy and the amount of infrastructure, it takes to build it up for the amount of energy you get. I think there's a mismatch right now, right?

But the premise of capturing like direct capturing in an integrated way, the places where energy is already being expended in the system is just beautiful. Like, I would love to know that there's thousands of people working on this right now of like when all this excess energy that just dissipates like we give the example earlier in the episode of the exercise bikes in front of the tv the TVs being powered by coal energy and the exercise bike is releasing energy into the ether capturing.

Energy capture system. It scratches my, like buckminster Fuller, big brain, utopian, kind of idea like to the degree that's feasible. I'm in favor of implementing it entirely. That's stuff is like such a brain tickler. I think I talked about hot water capture, it was one of the things in the passive house thing before, but like the idea that like, you're hot water going down, the drain, after you shower has heat in it, that's energy.

And then it's just like, we just drain it out into the sewers and like, let the heat energy dissipate. That's a real technology. People are already talking about because he'd energies actually like really valuable and like thinking about homes in terms of solar thermal or like moving heat and where he should be used.

It's a version of that capturing technology or capturing energy that already exists,

A friend of mine could test drive, all the expensive, electric cars, and it was really fun and they can go really fast really quickly and ways that gasoline engines. Can't and like, yeah, electric cars aren't my preferred transportation method of the future, that everyone's going to use in all situations but they are really cool technology.

And one of the ways they do, this thing that you were talking about, is there were some speakers talking about how capturing the energy from breaking in these things work. So good. Now that when you're in bc, driving in the mountains, when you're going downhill, you're charged. Generally is going up rather than down because it's capturing so much like electricity from a breaking when you're going down the mountains.

Yeah, so the friction of the break pad is being captured as energy. That's being used to charge the battery of the vehicle. Yeah. Yeah. That's extremely dough and like gasoline engines lose so much energy to heat. I think it was like, 80, or 90 percent or something of the energy isn't used to actually propel the vehicle for it.

It's just like making your engine really.

The I just want the front third of the car to be really hot, right? So please spend 80 percent of the energy on that. Like say no more sir and they make the adjustments of the car. Oh, you know another technology like one of those sort of pie in the sky maybe not worth it things like the the street that captures the pressure of people walking on it is so solar paint.

I've seen people talk about like you can paint a house or a roof or anything a car with paint that captures solar energy and then you can be used to charge things or put it into the grid. The idea of like being able to capture as much of the suns and energy hitting the surface of the earth as possible and especially like at point of source where it's going to be used because that's one of the really cool things about solar panels in general.

Is that like if you have solar panels like on your house or whatever, or you're building and you're using that electricity there and your house and your building, there's like a huge efficiency benefit to using electricity. Have to be transported anywhere. Yeah, because I'm a bunch of energies lost as it moves along the wires, right?

Yeah. The distributed nature of solar panels and how flexible they are and how useful they are like. At this point you can like create more energy than you're using just by having solar panels on your house if you have a house and not in an apartment, In most places, you can do that.

There's something really powerful about like things being able to just generate their own power at source where they are cutting down on the need for things like power plants in general. Like when you think of like all almost all power plants, there's always fucking problems with them. Hydroelectric downs, fucking up the surrounding environments, coal or like fossil fuel ones pumping shit into the solar panels are awesome.

I think like solar panels are a big part of one of those revolutionary technologies that are just like starting to really I think really feel the impact of them. Yeah. I think the fully automated luxuryans are right. The cornucopians here are right about how cool this text stuff is, how it's like exciting.

And you can imagine a a cool wonderful society that includes the implementations of good machine and learning. Asteroid mining jobs being automated that suck. I'm in favor of all that but I also I feel like the low tech low tech is even the right?

Hammer or something, but something like a fellow mobile. The thing that uses a combination of aerodynamics and human power and batteries to like achieve car-level performance with way, way less energy use, that's still, it's high tech in a way, it's not computerized, it does, it's not running code, it doesn't have LCD screens on it, but that level of engineering, to be able to achieve.

That kind of thing is high tech in a way those sorts of like, low tech, high tech things. I think are also really, really exciting and cool. But I think what won't work is if the technological trajectory that we try to get on is through the existing system wherever year, we use more and more materials produce more and more stuff than the year before more stuff that's built to break.

More and more useless disposable shit quantity. Over quality slightly bigger tv every year you know slightly brighter LCDs are deeper blacks. Come on. So it's all about for the

With deeper blacks, in fact, some on the market first, some deeper blacks, myself once my paycheck clears. But the I've got no problem with deeper blacks in theory, but in the way that our current technological system works under capitalism is it's run for a short-term profit sometimes at the expensive consumers.

Always at the expense of the environment, none of the tech industry is sustainable at all in terms of hardware manufacturing. Every year in order to justify marketing to a narrow subset of consumers who always buys the newest thing and gets rid of the last thing. So to make sure that they buy something every year, they manufacture devices that don't need to exist.

Manufacturing billions of cell phones. When we already have too many cell phones to meet, everyone's needs. And again, I don't have a problem with, you know, progress on better and better cell phones and stuff. But we need to approach it in a modeable rational way that understands that there is a finite amount of resources available.

Yeah. Yeah. No. Totally. This tv, I have here is like six months old. It's a new TV. The old one was discolored. Like there was like weird colored strips on it that were like distract

Fix that. But if it was like built and like an ecologically modular way where you can like find whatever the, you know, easily access the information first of all, for which part needs to be changed and then be able to get just that part and change it out. I would have done that rather than getting a new one because this isn't even an OLED TV, it doesn't even have deeper blacks.

I couldn't afford that way to expensive. So I just got the same kind of tv that I had before is a bit thinner and newer for sure, but that's about it. And my old one, I just put behind the sofa to deal with what? I don't know. Sometimes it's just, it's just sitting back there.

I put it out of my sight and was like, yeah, I'll figure that out sometime because you're not supposed to leave them by the trash can. So you're like drive it somewhere I guess I'll just leave it behind the sofa. And I mean this is why this is exactly.

This is why we're library socialist because we're dehumanized by this whole process like now you're guilty. Now you're this guilty trash dragon that you always have this fucking weight around your neck until

In his heart when it's probably the case that a better working tv could have an easily subable single part that could be ordered directly that would be cheaper than buying a new television would cause the existing television to work sufficiently and upgrades too. Could also happen in a more modular way.

You know, there's like a new kind of phone screen technology. That's better. You don't have to, like, make all new phones. If screens were modular, you could just make new screens to fit, onto the old phones. So yeah, like yeah, the technology is great, but part of the ecological aspect of, it isn't just like advancing the technology until it gets better until it's like ecological.

Suddenly it's thinking about how we use the technology. All the things we've been talking about the whole episode building it to last making it modular making it shareable through a library's commenting system. Having a fully realized full recycling system. So that items are captured and repaired or broken down into parts and those parts used for another thing.

This episode of seriously wrong is proudly brought to you by the symbiotic. Synergetic complementarity of a full circulation, economy, library socialism and a layered direct democracy. Library socialism makes full use of humanities physical and intellectual resources, using, engineering and design to respect material goods. Never using more than as needed, and using the social technology of sharing to create a more abundant fuller, symbiotic whole direct democracy is an extension of this principle recognizing that reason is a group process and that our group decisions can be strengthened by making space for everyone to have their needs perspectives and contributions taken seriously and made full use of.

We are all collectively more knowledgeable than any of us can be individually and taking advantage of the vast differences and knowledge and experience in a population through democratic processes is called swarm intelligence.

Who do know about a given subject are given platform to have their perspectives reflected and group action. And similarly in production repair recycling, and the structures of a library economy, a confederation of collaborative specializations can make the whole function greater than the sum of its parts. Buckminster Fuller's, principal of 10, segrity, the types of integrity that come through tension and building materials also applies to the democratic process, where the productive tensions between differing voices within Democratic engagement and discussion can strengthen our ability to make decisions that positively impact our society, and our ecosystems, a democratic tensegrity.

Time for democracy, we need less compulsory labor. Unless compulsory labor is highly compatible with maintenance and repair over raw production. Unless raw production is highly compatible with our overall climate goals which are also enriched by the repair economy and the library economy. Democracy is also highly compatible with climate, just think about it, over the era, where climate change has become an acute threat due to human activity.

There was almost no, participatory ecological democracy to speak of at all. It's structures of hierarchy and domination that prioritize their own personal well-being, over the ecological system, people working to together in a democratic system, looking at the best evidence and listening to the best expertise will work together to actuallyize an ecological society because that is an all of our common interests.

All of these suggestions are not only good in and of themselves. They are synergistic with one another, bringing out more from each other by working together as a

Large areas of the planet and the integration of ecosystems into our lives, as well as the abolition of intellectual property to spur on an ecological technological Renaissance. This is ecological luxury, the symbiotic, synergetic complementarity of a full circulation economy, library socialism and a layered direct democracy, proud, sponsor of seriously wrong.

Now back to our show,

We now go to buysworth on his deathbed with his son, little billy buys, worth at his side, giving his final statement Really, as I look back on my life is that oligarcha collector of items of things? It's I see something now boy. Oh yeah. Is it how to make more money?

Get more stuff. You want some? Last minute of the stock tips for little Billy. Something you want to give me right now? The code to a secret safe with extra billions. No boy. It was all. It was all hollow. Boy, this sickness The sickness of having of needing to accumulate.

No it's cheapened probably life. Destroyed our world probably buys worth you love accumulating you love having sub. You're being silly. What stop can't take it with you boy and I'm glad you can't. And finally be free of it. Oh this is the this is the death delusions talking. I don't know what this is.

This is look, look what it did to you. Oh, this money. I mean you always said that I was your precious little billy buysworth and you were proud of me. You No matter what. Yeah, really, but you personally cause animals to go extinct. That was one time that was, but it was three animals and one instance.

And I said that I was sorry. And we got you out of that mess. Yeah, you did. No. But look, this idea of private properties idea of hoarding were killing the planet over it. My generation. We would we would have killed the whole thing. This is crazy. Talk pop.

You're sounding like those people who want to take our yacht away I realized now boy that right. Next part here, won't make any sense unless we explain the yacht grandfathering system in post library, socialist revolutionary wrongtown. During the transition as a token of goodwill, the middle class and rich were allowed to keep a certain amount of privately owned luxuries that during the transition to a library.

Socialist property relations, they could keep In the case of the buysworth, family, specifically, he opted to hold on to his precious darling. Super yacht the policy agreed upon by. The Confederation is to allow these grandfathered luxuries to persist until the death of the property holder, when buysworth dies, his luxury yacht is going to the boat depot for processing.

This is a problem for little Billy Bysworth because he lives on that luxury yacht. They're right little billy buys worth. No, it's going to the boat depot whether we like it or not. I was hoping some last minute advice on that, maybe actually how I could keep it. I honest advice.

Let go that. No, that's current wash you into other. How? You know, under the society, there's enough housing. You go have housing nonetheless. Yeah, but it won't be better than everybody else's and won't be on the ocean like you won't be maybe beautiful. I realized now that the boat isn't better than the not boat, that was just a lie.

We told ourselves to feel better than everyone else, uh, but we are better than everybody else. We're not billy. This is when I die, I'm going to be begging whoever. Judges us to see me as the same as them. All right, so it's the saddest one, they lose it at the end, like this, let go of the family yacht, the library socialists are right?

You can have access to everything you want and more through the ecological power of sharing and direct democracy is a good. It's a good revolution boy. I see that now, Clearly. Definitely feel like I'm about to die. Do you have anything that you want to? Like, do you want to have a tender moment?

Yeah, I don't know. I'm just kind of I'm kind of pissed at you right now because you're being such a dick right before you die. But oh dick. What was it? What are you talking about? Telling me to give up the yard and so I don't know. I don't yeah, let's have a precious moment.

It's not up to me. I'm not like what would you want me to do? In charge of yachts, tell me how to escape with the odd and keep it how to overthrow society about. You tell me how to fly upwards with no wings. I don't know. I just thought you'd bail me out one last time with this yacht thing before I died.

I don't know. I'm literally, I'm about to die and I'm talking, you're talking about me bailing you out from. Yeah, for all times sake. One last time. Always thought that was your love language. It's Pop a little billy bailing them out. You know, goodbye son. Going into the light.

Spends worth. I love him.

No. No, the boat is gone. The boat. Oh, poor be over. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Now this won't make any sense. Unless we explain and the library economy in wrongtown, when someone's vital science, finish it sends a signal to a room full of professional comforters, to make sure that no one is alone with a loss of a loved one.

We're gonna take my boat away. They're there, your father was a strong boat of a man. You're right. We've done that boat since I was a boy. But I can't believe it's really gone. No. I won't accept it. I won't let them take my boat away. They're there. Everything's going to be all right.

Now, that means I have to be the man of the house. I have to be the one to make problems. Go away. That's right. Disappear when they're inconvenient just take some time to grieve. Everything's going to be. Okay, find your center before you go take action. Just take some time for you and wish I could but there's no time.

They're coming for the boat. I have to get my weapons. I'm starting to lose the boat metaphor metaphor at this point with your father, being a boat. You've lived on sincere. I live on a boat. All right, interesting. But he owns it and they're gonna take it away, right?

And I'm gonna stop him. That's what i've resolved due to this conversation. Thank you for helping me. Realize that it's time for. Me to take a stand against the society. We all process grief in different ways, your father, obviously meant quite a lot to you and this fantasy is a way of centering yourself right now.

You know, if I succeed you'll get your own boat too. Oh well, thank you very much. Link. It's a billy buysworth wink. Well, thank you, billy advisoryth. Order in the court order in the court. Little billy buys worth. You stand here accused. Of the heinous crime of maliciously sinking your family yacht to prevent its expropriation for youth by the people's assemblies.

How do you plead? Your honor. I plead civil disobedience. I did sink that ship, but it was not mere property, destruction without a purpose. There was a political message behind it, which is protected by the library socialist constitution. For you, see a society where all can own yachts is a society where great men have nothing to strive for great men like myself and my father Entrepreneurs, who made the world, what it is today, who built this thing from the ground up.

That's me. And our society today keeps us down and as long as we aren't allowed to own private yachts or private heated swimming pools or private, jets, or Any number of other private things just for us that any other people can't have Then there is a rot at the heart of this society.

Bed needs to be excised. Thank you. All right, we will keep that spirited and Interesting defense in mind while issuing sentencing. I find you guilty and I'm going to sentence you to making things, right? I'm gonna give you like a little bit of lenient or whatever because it's political disobedience, but still, you can't do that.

You can't think of the, the political excuse doesn't fly. You can appeal it if you want, whatever. But I'm just telling you that's not going to fly not under this system. So I'm going to send and see you to first. We need to make restitution for the sinking of the yacht.

The yacht needed to be pulled up. They brought it to a place, they dried it off. Now they're repairing the yacht from where you shot holes in it. This took fuel energy man hours. So once all that's calculated, you're going to have to do that many hours of work, the amount of energy it took to do it.

You're going to have to generate via stationary bicycle. Enforce them. I can't give you much leniency on this, so that's I you have to make that basic restitution. This is totalitarianism fascism. Uh secondly, you're going to be assigned. A lifestyle coach, who can help identify the needs? You have that were being met by that yacht and then can help you to meet those needs within the library system.

So you feel, you know, evalued member of society, just because you did. This doesn't mean we don't accept you and want to welcome you. And, you know, give you all the luxuries that everyone's entitled to. And I think your needs can be met if if you open up your mind a little bit.

Poison apple dipped in sugars still poison and finally you're going to be sentenced to court mandated video blogging about your journey as I'm sure you're aware, we've got a large audience of people who absolutely love these criminal video blogs and they comment on it. They cheer for them, they pick favorites, they cry when they relapse, they cheer.

When they successfully, you know, leave the life of crime and so on, I know it's a little bit of a humiliating and some say, outdated punishment, but I think in this case, unfortunately some severity is warranted. Given the heinous nature of the crime. This little billy buys worth, you need to make peace with bias worth dying.

He's really dead. I think you're using this property stuff as a way to Hold on to your dad. I'm sorry. I recently lost my father as well. And I just see myself in you right up. Sorry. Well, you give me a hug everybody. Everybody get out of the stands.

And come big group hug. Let's show him. He's welcome. He's going through a lot right now. It's not dog pile. Them You're one of us, buddy. You're one of us. You're always going to be welcome in our world. And I'll just pop out that tape. Well, there you have it, folks.

Three beautiful hours of ecological luxury. This has been our season 9 finale. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you so much for listening. Our longest episode ever. I feel accomplished. It's uh yeah and this season 9 it's our second longest season ever and longest season in terms of how many months it lasted like when you say second longest you're talking about in terms of number of episodes in which case it's the second longest behind the first season.

Yeah. And we're going to take a little break from releasing new episodes for just a little while so we can rest up and then start working on the next season and some other projects. But we will be back with new episodes in february between now and then we will have some more bonus episodes for our patreon community and we'll be re-releasing some classic episodes in the main feed with brand new transcripts.

But yeah, I'm excited to take a break, you know, this episode was a big project, feels like a good one to and on for

I really enjoyed making this episode and I hope you all enjoyed listening to it. There's something kind of there's, i, it's kind of iron like you do the show because, and you're working a lot on it. And then you're editing yourself talking about the virtue of taking breaks and the virtue, if not working all the time, and working long on the one hand, we're like, vacations are great.

You know, we support vacations. Everybody deserves vacations all the time days off. We should have shorter work weeks, but then when we're like looking at the stats and like episode releases and patreon numbers and we're like, oh my god. No, we have to keep putting things out. We got to get right into another episode. It's like three weeks. It's more to finish this one. Oh my god. Yeah, it's good. To take a break every now and then no matter what you do, the human organism requires uptime and downtime is a sharp thoughtful wrong boy. Exactly. Thank you all so much for listening.

We will see you next time.

Yeah, we will see you all very soon, and if you're subscribed on Patreon, we will see you even sooner.
