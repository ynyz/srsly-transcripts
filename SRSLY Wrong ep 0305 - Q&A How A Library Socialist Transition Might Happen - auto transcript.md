Transcript 

Shawn
Warning hard times are coming when we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now can see through our fear stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being. And even imagine real grounds for hope. We'll need writers who can remember freedom, poets, visionaries, realists. Of a larger reality. That's Ursula K leguin. And nailed it honestly. 

Aaron
Yeah. Nailed it, Ursula. Thank you. 

Speaker
You are right. Right. 

Shawn
This episode of Seriously Wrong is brought to you by wrong boys revolutionary doulas. 

Aaron
Push, push, push, push. Congratulations. It's an ecological and democratic society. 

Shawn
Thank you, Ron. Boys, that was such a painless process. All thanks to your incredible doula services. You're welcome. 

Aaron
Our pleasure. Hi, I'm Aaron and I'm Sean. And we're revolutionary doulas making the process of birthing a new world as smooth and safe as possible for everybody. 

Shawn
Look, we know a lot of revolutions are unsafe. Births, they can be painful, uncomfortable. They can have bloodshed. They can even be violent. 

Aaron
Obviously, birth doesn't always go the way you want, but we work as hard as we can to make sure that it goes as well as possible. 

Shawn
You know a lot of shitty doulas say ohh birth it's inherently violent. The mother has to bleed and cry. There needs to be tearing. This is just hard nosed realism, you know? But sometimes it's historically necessary for the mother to die during childbirth. These shitty doulas. I mean, that's just crappy. 

Aaron
Yeah, it's a horrible thing to say. 

Shawn
And it's a little misogynistic. Honestly. 

Aaron
Yeah, I mean, to be frank, sometimes in birth there is some tearing and it can be painful, but you know, you shouldn't uphold tearing. You shouldn't act like doulas are naive for trying to make birth as painless as possible. You shouldn't be indifferent to whether the mother lives or dies. 

Shawn
And sure, in the event of a traumatic revolutionary birth, we should have a plan. To heal after that. But some people actually lionize tearing they they lionize the suffering as necessary and righteous the suffering, particularly of women. 

Aaron
Yeah, and that's just bad duelist skills. Makes people not want to give revolutionary birth. 

Shawn
Now, we've been a doula for many years, and it's just not the case. That birth trauma can never be avoided. We should always do everything we can to prevent discomfort, pain and damage and bring that beautiful society into being. 

Aaron
We do safe births here from fetus, pregnant with the new world, in our hearts to labor and birth. 

Shawn
And. To child rearing too. You know, our new society has to grow big and healthy and strong. 

Speaker
Yes. 

Aaron
So we'll train you up breathing exercises, squatting, stretching, nutritional and sleep health. All of these things can help lead to a safe birth and a healthy and safe birth means a healthy and safe society. 

Shawn
You can hold our hand as you give birth to this new world. You can do our breathing exercises and we're going to tell you you're doing such a great job. We are so proud of you. 

Aaron
You're doing great. 

Shawn
We believe in you. 

Aaron
Wrong boys. Revolutionary doula services all the support you need for a safe birth. 

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome back to the Seriously Wrong podcast. This is our first bonus episode of Season 10. 

Aaron
It's the transition Q&A, Part 2. We've been excited to make this one ever since last we left you on a nice Cliff hanger gonna be talking about elections going to be talking about insurrections this episode. 

Shawn
Yeah, there was questions we didn't get to last time because we ran out of time. And there's also, we've been soliciting feedback and saying, hey, give us critiques like real. It's like, I mean you can call us wieners or whatever if you want, or dipshits or whatever. 

Aaron
In part 3 we'll be answering all the questions of. Aren't you guys wieners be like what? We'll we'll have to answer that. 

Shawn
Yeah. I I, yeah, no spoilers, but we will be answering that. 

Aaron
Like we gotta. 

Shawn
In the first Q&A, we talked about sort of first steps towards library socialism and a kind of strategy for utopian trajectory. It's not the only possible strategy, but it's one that we're happy to endorse that we've been talking and thinking about and the basic elements of that are building satellite research group so you can improve our knowledge and work together and working groups to understand things better than we can understand just by ourselves to form a confederation of helper groups that do things in community that benefit people in a material way, not posturing. About high falutin politics, but focusing on the day-to-day things that actually help people confederating that as a political body that then can make political demo. Ends and do externally, politically organized things and as part of an overall strategy of what we called our revolution of conscience, which is people from different walks of life and different areas of society, different positions and different roles within it being moved through ethics, moved to understand and desire and work for a transition to an ecological. And democratic. Society society that gives everyone a voice, treats everyone with respect and which you know ultimately results in a democratic and ecological society. For I already said that, but it's important. Maybe I'll end on that one cut out there earlier one and cut out me saying this. Or maybe I'll just keep it all in because editing is actually what we spend. The most time on on this show. 

Aaron
Yeah, well, all right. Let's get started on some of these questions. So we finished up the last episode on a question about the strategic benefits of authoritarianism. And this next question continues in that topic. Wouldn't it be easier to get a small group together to undertake an authoritarian program rather than get the mass democratic and participatory buy in that library socialism proposes? 

Shawn
No, it would not be easier. Next question. But. 

Aaron
Yeah. No, I think it genuinely is not easier like the idea of building up the amount of military or militia force or whatever you would need to take over a country, a modern nation state. Is not like an easy thing. I understand that getting democratic and participatory buy in for a new society where everybody's needs are taken care of. It sounds daunting, but like I don't know personally to me, it also sounds daunting to try and think about overtaking a military force with force and instituting your ideas over everybody else. Isn't being pedantic on the? Wouldn't it be easier thing? No, it wouldn't be. 

Shawn
Easier. Yeah, I don't really. I think that's also not pedantic because this is this is like the clear argument and a lot of like radical left spaces. It's treated as common sense that, like, this is a matter of what's easier. Like we have to compromise our values to do things the easy way. 

Aaron
But for the effect. Way. 

Shawn
Or yeah, exactly. But it's not the it's just. It's not the case that it it, you know, people could cite examples of times where there's been, like, violent uprisings and stuff like that. But there's really no reason to think that that sort of trajectory is more effective at achieving the ultimate ends that we want to have, which is a democratic and ecological. Ethical, socially oriented society because that has never been achieved. There's never been something that attacks and dismantles the qualitative sort of features of capitalism. You know of private property and hoarding of hierarchical domination. The use of coercion and threats to achieve productivity and so on that's never been escaped through this kind of trajectory that's treated. It's common sense and a lot of left spaces. 

Aaron
Yeah, I think like part of the ohh it's effective or it's easier thing or if you look at history kind of arguments on this stuff, I think comes from. The like if. You do look at history. You'll see there's been a lot of authority. In regimes that have, you know, lasted for a long time, some of them many hundreds of years, there's been monarchies, there's been, you can talk about modern capitalist states that have been implemented by force and pushed onto the populations of a place. And you could say that was effective. That worked, but you know this monarchy lasted a really long time because people were forced into it by an authoritarian show of force, of military forcing people to exist under the thumb of this regime. Name but authoritarian methods being effective in implementing an authoritarian style of governance where the people don't have a say where it's not participatory, where it's not democratic, where people aren't equal members of the society who all have a say in the running of that society makes sense that. Is an effective way of doing that. It's not an effective way of implementing the kind of society that we want. So the mass democratic and participatory buying the library socialism proposes, and like an optional add-on part to that it would be nice to. Have if it's possible, but if not, we can just impose it authoritarian only and it'll work just as well. It's like actually the core part of it. It's like the whole reason that we want to do it is to have that participatory democratic society. If you don't have that part, then you don't have the thing that you wanted. You're not transitioning to the thing that you wanted. You're transitioning to something else, you're. Forcing something else on people. 

Shawn
Yeah, I I think a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that because they can more easily and quickly understand something like ohh we have a really strong guy who's also really right and he tells everyone what to do and that's step one. And then that's also the final step. It seems really simple. But just because something simple to grasp doesn't mean it's actually simple to do. Like where are we going to find this? Guy who's perfectly morally right and perfect. Be strong. How are you gonna make people do what he like? It's actually really complicated. Like it's insanely complicated and especially mapping it. To the real. World if you think about like leaving your house, talking to your neighbors, and imagining this is happening and just like I don't try pitching them on this and see what they say, and then try pitching them on the concept of a more democratic society, a more ecological. Decide. You're gonna find that they generally agree with, like, good, nice things. And they generally have a a bit of a wall up to the idea of being forced to do things against their will by some sort of authoritarian. Cross act and that actually poses a really serious barrier to political organizing, because even if you're not trying to convince everyone you're trying to convince a sufficient amount of people for any sort of political change. 

Aaron
Yeah, I think another thing with this or the idea that it's easy to impose authoritarian state, then convincing. Everybody is that like what you just said of, like, try telling this to your neighbor like. If you start trying to impose things on people, creating more resistance to your ideas, you're actually preventing the spread or the acceptance of your ideas. You're preventing people from seeing the benefits of the type of society you're proposing because you're coding it in this like poison coating of like, Oh yeah, and we're going to force. You're. Everybody to do it with guns. And that's like. The place we start from and like you better listen to us or you're gonna be on the other side of this guy. You start saying that to me and then all of a sudden I'm like, **** library. So if this is what library socialists want to do, the March in the street with guns and force everybody to use their tool sheds or whatever, I'm like, yeah, maybe not. Maybe we shouldn't be doing that. Like, you're creating resistance to your idea. It's not easier. You're actually like adding extra barriers between the world you want and the world that you're. Gating and you don't even have to actually be doing it to be starting to create those barriers, just like talking about it as if that's the way to do it when it's clearly not when it's clearly not what anybody wants. It's clearly not an effective way to get the goal that you want to move towards. It's like. It might sound simple. To get a small group together to undertake an authoritarian program. But it also sounds simple, quote UN quote, to just convince everyone. We'll we'll just convince everyone. We'll talk to everyone. These ideas are reasonable, and we'll just convince everyone. Wouldn't it be simpler to just convince everyone to agree with you rather than to take on? Like the largest militaries in the world in an asymmetrical warfare situation to. That sounds like really difficult, really hard throwing up a whole bunch of extra barriers in your way, whereas like convincing everybody? Like. Sure. Yeah. Convincing people things. It's not easy. I've argued with a lot of people I don't know how many people I've convinced of things, but I have seen public opinion change a lot on a lot of issues. Constant pressure of different groups being out there, putting out the arguments just inches at a time, public perception of certain ideas that to me seems like a more viable path, an easier path. The less complicated path than the path of. Undertaking an authoritarian program with a small group of. 

Shawn
People. Yeah, and neither any any strategy for world transformation that can be summarized in so little words. As you know take over with an authoritarian leader or just convince everyone is going to just be wrong by itself. There's just no way you can fit in the totality of what's going to be required in the real world. With a tiny little boiled down meme like. That so we actually propose something that's a lot more complex than that, but the stuff that we talked about in both that last episode and in this new episode, it is oriented around, among other things, ease. Like, we're thinking of what is actually the easiest way. What is the most realistic way, what is accessible and what can be done with the speed that's required to address the. Races that. We have, I don't think an oversimplistic violence narrative or an oversimplistic kind of just convince people narrative is a sufficient easy solution for complex problems. These are complex problems. They require moral courage. They require real imagination. And yeah, the answers are sometimes going to be complex. Cause the world is complex and we embrace that. 

Aaron
Yeah, it might be easier to fantasize about just taking down the bad guys. And then winning and then everyone cheers at the end. But it's not reality. 

Shawn
Yeah. I mean, ultimately this comes down to respect and respecting people. And I don't wanna cosign. I don't think we wanna cosign anything that is just inherently, structurally disrespectful, dominating and so on. There's other elements of this, and I think we can get into them. By continuing, we've got more questions along these lines. Again, really popular questions and I know we're going to get some criticism for this and I welcome that criticism, like real substantive critical engagement is awesome. I also imagine we're just gonna get some, like insults, which is also fine. We'll respond to that in Part 3. So what's the next question? 

Aaron
Next question, how is it possible to distribute societies resources more equitably when the people who currently own the resources refuse to relinquish power? I know the pod has a sweetie pie attitude and I really appreciate that, but many other leftists who would otherwise agree with the end goal of Library Socialism criticized that approach. How do you envision? This transition happening in the light of that crisis. 

Speaker
Speak. 

Shawn
1st at the top level, if you like. Part of what we say and you don't like another part, take what you like. Leave behind what you don't like. That's great. That's awesome. But I think this question carries with it some implicit assumptions that we need to start from the base up and we need to dispel some myths, some misunderstandings. There's this type. Of radicalism. When. I think people are in a way trying to prove to others and to themselves that they're serious and so they advance this notion of social transformation as hell on Earth. They advance this notion of social transformation as this inherently brutal, horrible, violent, unappealing, dangerous. Horrible thing that they're tough. To manage and to imagine but what that does in effect is by playing up how scary social transformation is by playing up the inherent violence and mass death of social transformation. And just to be clear, I don't agree with any of these things at all. I think it's actually a totally wrong way to think about social transformation. So people advance all this stuff partially because they want to prove to themselves that they're serious. But what this does in effect is it sabotages the capacity for social transfer. Information because we're thinking people are thinking 10 steps ahead to a fictionalized scenario where you know, no matter what sort of means towards social transformation is being pursued, it inevitably ends in a place where there's, you know, catastrophic violence, where the bad guys must be fought and so on. And in doing that, they sabotage the first steps. Which is getting a mass buy in getting people to support the ideas. And again what we're doing is when we talk about this stuff too much and in the wrong way is we attach these weights of hopelessness to ideas that people will largely support. And for a lot of people, if they have. This notion of ohh the only way social transformation happens is this way. Well, I still I don't want that. So I guess social transformation is impossible and then they move on with their lives. And The thing is we need social transformation. We need desperately for the sake of ourselves, for our children, for our children's children, the future of our planet. We need social transformation to an ecological and democratic society, so this this kind of like sunglasses cool, tough guy, you know, revolutionary chauvinism thing. It's not totally present in this question, but I think like, I just want to frame these types of questions in that context. That's how I see this. It's a type of self sabotage to. Argue that there's this inherent deep tie between social transformation and mass violence and scariness, and so on, and I totally reject that. I don't think that's actually true. 

Aaron
Yeah, I struggle sometimes understanding where people like this are coming from, not even this specific question. Whoever asked this or any of the other specific, but I don't know. It's like it's like there's this feeling of common sense that like obviously it would be nice to be sweetie pie. But. Realistically, it's gonna end up in like, a civil war. It's gonna end up in people dying, and it just doesn't. I don't think that's true. I don't think it's realistic to say that that's inevitable. I don't think that starting from the place of. And that's where we're headed and that's where we have to put our primary efforts towards, like the society that we want to build isn't a society with constant wars and militias and people being armed up and trained. Self defence. You know, I'm not going to say self-defense is wrong or there will never be a situation where there's like armed conflict ever at any point in the future. Obviously not. There's armed conflict going on right now. There's mass death going on right now. There's horrifying things happening in the world right now, and none of them are leading to a better society, a social transformation. To a better world, like the idea that these things are like inherently tied and like, aren't you just being unrealistic by not assuming that that's where this is headed and that we have to? Add to that momentum, we have to move in that direction intentionally because that's where it's going anyway, and that's what we should be preparing for. It seems like a self fulfilling prophecy in the wrong direction. And then like, yeah, the actual question asked, like, how is it possible to distribute societies resources more equitably when the people who currently own the resources refuse to relinquish power? It's a failure of imagination to think that, you know, we say, hey, will you relinquish power? And they say no. And then we're like, alright. Time to get the gun. First of all, there's a lot of resources in the world, and there's a lot of things that could be distributed more equitably without even taking anything from the world's most powerful people. And I'm all for taking things from the world's most powerful people. I think they have too much power and steps should be taken all along the way to diminish that power, to make people. More. Equal, but it feels like a failure of imagination to me to think that the only possible way that anybody is going to give up any power in relation to the system that they currently have is by forcing them using violence. And like there's so many different ways that groups of people, organized groups of people. Putting pressure on the levers of power in society can chip away at the accumulated power of the most powerful people in society. You can take things from people who don't want them taken away from them without necessarily it coming to guns. And yeah, they probably won't want us to take it away from them. But I mean, it's kind of a meme that people think like, oh, you'll never convince the bourgeoisie to go over to your side. You never can convince. Rich people to have this moment of clarity where they're like. Yeah, you're right. I want to join social. But like the whole point of a library, socialist society is that it's going to provide for everybody's needs. It's going to give everybody a say in the society. And like, yes, if you're currently like one of the most powerful people in the world, your say will be smaller than it was before. And maybe that's not attractive to you, but maybe it is. Maybe like setting down that burden that you've put on yourself, that you have to be the one who controls everything would be attractive. Maybe I think the society that we're proposing is desirable enough in its own right that if people genuinely like saw the vision that we saw, saw that it was possible, they would want to participate in it. Everybody, I'm talking. I'm not talking about just the poor people. They're just the people on the bottom of various axes of oppression. I'm talking about everybody. I think it's a vision that is genuinely attractive to everybody, and I'm not saying that every single person will be easy to convince or even possible to convince. There may be specific people who like, are so determined to defend the current system that they turn to violence. I just don't think it should be the. Primary method thought about and I don't think that it's like this slam dunk effective thing that we had in our back pocket that we're just saying no, no we have to be sweetie. Pie. Let's not. This super effective method of like forcing them to relinquish power using the violence of the state. Take actions have consequences. Even if you're just building up like a militia or whatever for self-defense or for this idea that eventually they're going to attack us and then we're gonna come after them. Like you're creating reaction through what you're doing. 

Shawn
Yeah. And the real world is not a choice between dumb option one, which is magically. Convince everyone and dumb Option 2, which is magically have sufficient people and sufficient force to violently dispossess. People both of those concepts are magical thinking. If we're thinking about a real world process, an unfolding process, there's a strategy to it. We have to be thoughtful. We have to think step by step. So we're not going to be marching down the street as a small group of, you know, we weakened numbers but with authoritarian ideology or whatever. Like, we're coming to take all your things. From you? Because like, yeah, obviously people will react to that immediately. But taxes are increased sometimes, and there's no violent reaction. There's there's all sorts of ways that people are dispossessed of things without creating violent reaction. People are successfully dispossessed of unearned gains without violent reaction, so we have to think strategically in the long term. But what comes, you know, order of operations, we're talking about empowering people. First, we're talking about building up an appealing large scale movement. First, our first order of operations is not showing up to Jeff Bezos house with pitchforks. And dispossessing him, even if getting rid of the excesses of the wealthy is a desirable A desirable aspect of the overall trajectory, we can think about this sort of pragmatically in the real world as we. And there's multiple and another answer to this kind of question that we floated before is there's the possibility of grandfathering certain rights. So you could have in order to minimize reaction through a like a A say like a legislative process or something you could allow people who have certain privileges who are at high risk. Of you know, reactionary resistance. You could allow them to keep a higher level of privileges than is actually deserved for the last, you know, 20 years of their life, some old man or whatever. Let him keep his yacht, even though in the future there's not going to be yachts the same way. Anymore. And by doing that you can soften the blows. There's a lot of different strategic again, we need moral imagination on this. We need creativity. But I don't see this as this, this. Penetrable barrier that the only answer is imagining that there's eventually going to be some righteous conflict in the streets, some righteous conflict where violence fights violence, and we have to prepare to win. For that, I just reject that entirely as a necessary, inescapable aspect of social transformation. Again, let's use our imaging. Questions along these same lines, another comment that we got recently. Basically all social transformation on anything approaching the necessary scale to confront capitalism has so far involved mass death. It's not desirable, but this seems to be reality. How do you account? For this. 

Aaron
I don't know when in the past we've successfully confronted capitalism using mass death and like overcome it somehow. Like if we're talking about a social transformation to the type of society that we, as Leftist Socialist Library socialists, want to move to. Words under the list of things that have never got us to that point is mass destruction. Movements involving mass death. You could say that those things challenged capitalism. I would be curious as to which specific historical examples you're talking about. A lot of the ones people point to, I would just see as like institution. Of a different form of capitalism. Again, you know, moving from feudalism to state capitalism and the Russian Revolution or like there's. 

Shawn
Yeah, there's that old Russian joke that communism is the transitionary stitch between capitalism and capitalism. 

Aaron
Right, exactly. And like. Like I said in the last question, like massive death is already happening and mass death is on the horizon. Thinking about what's to come in the next decades with like climate migrations and extreme climate events harming people that continued. Sort of global terror campaign of the military mights of the. World. So like it's one thing to me. If you're saying that you know, mass death is inevitable in the future because of the inherited situation. But the politics of socialism, the politics of making an egalitarian society like it seems to me, would have to inherently include as like a base notion. The idea of minimizing mass death, the idea that mass death isn't a means to any, and that is worth going after. And like, I don't think that that's just like a moral statement of like ohh it would work. But but it's it's a horrible means that we shouldn't do it. It's there is a moral element to it, and it is like wrong. But it's also not a means to any ends that I actually want to move towards. Every example of like attempting social change through mass death in history. 

Shawn
Yeah, there's a natural element to it. 

Aaron
That I can think of has either completely failed to institute anything that I would be a supporter of, or it has just completely failed at all at instituting any. And has just been crushed and the mass death was mostly on the side of the people trying to ostensibly fight for something that's. 

Shawn
Right. Yeah. Ohh man. And there's why why would we be so foolish as to paint ourselves in this corner of using the framing of our most, you know, sinister ideological enemies, the people who like if you say, I think Universal Healthcare is a good thing and then they say, well, that kind of requires mass death. Wasn't it? And then you? Say yeah, I guess, but I guess I will have to support that then. Like, how foolish are you? You are using their exact language, their exact misrepresentation of your politics to advocate for your own politics. Do you know how incompetent that is? Do you know how far away from any sort of communications role you should be? If that is the way that. 

Aaron
You're talking. Yeah. Sorry. That's such a good point. Cause, like, the main thing that they say against communism in the 20th century or whatever is like ohh it caused mass death. It caused all this mass death, the history of communism is the history of mass death. These communists, they, it works in theory, but in practice it ends up in mass death. And then we have like. 

Shawn
Aren't you the group that wants to do mass death? 

Aaron
And then you have communists in the current society in the world today being like, yeah, no, they're right about that mass death thing. It does require a lot of mass that trust me. It'll be so much better in the end after. 

Shawn
But want to buy our newspaper? 

Aaron
Look. Yes, mass death. But think about what's after the mass death. It's going to be beautiful if you survive the mass death, there's gonna be rainbows. There's gonna be sunshine. 

Shawn
Yeah. And it's not even a guarantee. This is the thing. It's like, OK, even even if we accept it, which I don't underline, don't I do not accept this? I do not. Do not do not accept this but. Even if we accepted that that was some necessary part of this. You're not actually proposing let's do mass death to guarantee this perfect outcome. You're saying let's do math. Let's start doing mass death now in hopes. Fingers crossed that it will have that outcome afterwards, but there's still some amount of chance that you're doing. A bunch of killing for no reason. You're doing a bunch of killing without creating that actual outcome because you look around all these examples of times where there's been, you know, these violent incidents and they have not resulted in deep transformations to the global capitalist system that people are advocating for. So you're basically saying, let's bet on mass death and fingers crossed. It works out. No, I do not bet on mass death. I'm not willing to cross that moral line of like advocating or cosigning killing people, the least of which, you know, mass death implies A indiscriminate civilian death. The death of children. You will never get me to cosign that in my life. And I'm not going to pretend that that's necessary. It's like, what? Because we took the principled stance that we're never going to approve of killing children. We were so close to revolution, guys, but we just didn't kill enough children. No. **** you. Get step away from the microphone. Step away from the microphone and never talk about politics again. You have nothing to do with us. That is such a *******. Crazy bad idea. And you were so incompetent at talking about this stuff that you're actively setting us back years when we have almost no time. I think also there's two overlapping logical fallacies in this claim that if we look all through history, mass death is required, the first of which is that, you know all history. You do not know all history. Do not pretend you know all history and #2 second fallacy that even if you did know all of history, which you don't, but assuming you did that you could read back the entirety of history and then come up with laws that apply. Cleanly to all future scenarios. That is also not true. 2 nested fallacies there. I'm sorry, but you're wrong. Step away from the microphone. 

Aaron
Say this is a final question. In this sort of vein, you talked about a revolution of conscience based on convincing large portions of the population towards library socialism. However, history shows that the state does not tolerate competing power structures are rising inside of it. What is the plan if the state decides to destroy the movement? Now? This is a really, really big question. And it's like it's open-ended in a way that, I mean, I think there's an implication here that I really don't like, but I think. There's a real, genuine question here of what would you do if you're, like, building this burgeoning movement and the state decides to destroy it. But the difficulty with answering that question is like, it's so context specific and dependent. And it's like, what is the movement? What? What point is the movement at at this point is there like. A small group of people in a municipality who have been like setting up tool sheds in their. Neighborhood and the state doesn't like it. They're trying to, like, crush it using legal means. Well, maybe in that situation you need to hire a lawyer and, like, fight them in. 

Shawn
Court and yeah, and you need to tweak your strategies to work around their legal their legal limits. You also have to make appeals to public conscience. You need to be like, hey, we're doing this thing that's totally harmless. Giving out socks to the homeless and they're attacking and they're trying to crush what we're doing. They're trying to stop us from handing out food this. Is messed up and so you can both pivot towards things that aren't currently criminalized and appeal to the public to restore your ability to do those things. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Aaron
Or say that you're much further along at this. There's like you have there. There's there's town, municipal councils, neighborhood councils set up in cities all across the country, and you've networked them together and they're making decisions. It's a powerful voting bloc. It's interacting with the state while existing as a separate power structure inside of it. They're providing medical care to people they're providing. Goods and services to people. It's become a sort of burgeoning library socialist economy within the larger eco. I mean and it's become so large that the federal government has decided that it's a threat to the nation and they're gonna crack down on it with the force of the military. Let's say that's the situation there. The implied, I think, answer that this question wants to get at for that is, well, you have to be prepared for that. You have to already have had like a militia movement set up inside this system that you've been building, which I think is an issue in and of itself, because if you're spending a whole bunch of, you're already limited resource, it's going to be difficult to build that kind of a dual power mutual aid. Library, Socialist Democratic dual power organization within the capitalist system in the 1st place because there's so many pressures on it from the outside already trying to prevent that thing from happening. And if you're spending a whole bunch of your man hours, your resources, your time and energy, your thought and effort into also building up a militia. At the same time, it's taking away from the thing that would actually be the thing that's worth defending, which. With this mutual aid organization that is like providing things for people, this use of fraction. Property system where people are actually getting a benefit from the system. 

Shawn
And I'm I'm in favor of teaching people self-defense, including maybe you live in a place where you know you have firearms and stuff, how to safely use firearms and stuff. That could be a genuine thing in a confederation of helpers. That people could voluntarily participate in. Similarly, when it comes to like sort of hand to hand self-defense like you know there's classes for people who are victimized by patriarchal violence, like how to defend yourself against sexual assault and things like that. That's all valid. That's all part of the picture. But the the concept that like. In this this big showdown that Aaron's describing that you're going to be better off if you show up on the front lines armed, and then you start shooting and like, go to war with the state. That it's just. This is this is fantasy stuff like you have to be in kind of like a civil war scenario for anything like that to be a even a feasible aspect of an overall strategy. And God forbid we're in a civil war scenario. And then of course, if you're in a civil war scenario, then you have to have people who are militants fighting in a civil war and like that is if things have gotten that bad, things are pretty *******. 

Aaron
That, yeah. Well, and I mean, like the situation I was describing, like, you have these organizations set up, and they're networked across the entire country. Like, who exactly is the military targeting? Are they? Like sending troops to every major city to attack a thing that doesn't have a specific area that it's operating in, if they're operating all throughout the country, if you have councils running in this dual power situation all throughout the country, you're not sort of balkanized in one place with borders or like a wall around your little commune. Area or your autonomous zone, that they're able to attack. It's really difficult for them to find out who to attack and if the thing that your organization is doing is providing tools for people to borrow if they don't want to buy them, you're providing tents for people to use when they go camping. You're providing clothes for children so that people don't have to buy a whole bunch of clothes that their kid is going to grow out of. In C. Six months. The fact that the state is like now cracking down on you using violence, it's almost hard for me to imagine that happening, because why would they like? Why? Yes, it's a threat to their power in some abstract way, but even within the current society we have, there's like optics and legal precedent and. If you're not doing anything that's like militarily challenging them and the challenge to the property system you're mounting is offering an. Relative a dual power based alternative within the current society, it makes it really hard for them to have an excuse to attack you and talking like this, preparing for this thinking that this is inevitable. Acting like this is inevitable. Putting this as a first principle that this is inevitable, that this is what we're heading towards, that this is what we have to prepare for. That is the excuse that they need, they say. Ohh yeah. No, it looks like they're just, you know, putting tools for people to hand out. They're just offering resources and services and training and help for people. But if you look into what they're saying internally, they're preparing for a civil war. They're prep. To attack the United States military, we're going to attack them first. You're giving them the justification for the crackdown that you are using as your justification to treat this as a first principle, that this is the thing that we need to do to begin. 

Shawn
With, yeah, so we we propose something different. We talk about a revolution of conscience. We're imagining a scenario where we're keeping everything above. Forward. In the sense that we're doing things according to the stated logic of the system and that we are building organizations that are about helping people and we're we're nice. You know, we're helping people. We're not brandishing guns. We're not threatening people. We're not going through any of those things because we don't believe in that kind of stuff. We think it's a moral unethical and it won't work. 

Aaron
It's a type of self-defense to do that to have this like sort of ethical stance. 

Shawn
Right. Well, and that's the most primary form of self-defense you need if you want to try to build a mass movement that can actually challenge the existing system and create a transition to an ecological and democratic society, the way that they're going to attack you, the first thing that they're going to attack you with. Isn't going to be sending in military people and having a gun fight with you if you're doing mutual aid stuff, police might sweep you away. You might be made illegal and stuff like that and that. That's really more even even a second tier threat, the first tier threat is them saying these people are danger. They're crazy. They're violent, don't not support them, do not join them. They're evil. They've got secret goals, you know, basically on the PR front is where they're going to attack you first, right? And so we don't want to be handing them any easy wins by being like, yeah, we agree with your horrible framing of us. We're crazy and and violent, like, that's just not going to work for anyone. Again, please step away from the micro. Phone and in our view of the long term sort of transition of society is that you're building up support across all layers of society, not total support, but sufficient support. So when you go to your local grocery store, maybe not everyone there, but some of the staff members at that grocery store are sympathetic with you familiar with you. And maybe even participate in you in off hours when you go to Microsoft Corporation. Not everyone, but some people there are supportive of you understand who you are, maybe even participate, maybe donate and so on. When you go to your Congress, City Hall, etcetera, not everyone but some amount of people are familiar with your project, understand why you do what you do. They're sympathetic broadly, even if they don't agree with you and. When push comes to shove then they can help be on your side to defend you against sort of crackdowns. They can stand up for you in these institutions. They can stand up for you if they try to. You illegal. It's like we're putting these sort of tendrils of public opinion across society to the highest degree possible. Not a total degree, but to the highest degree possible. And that is our primary mode of self-defense. 

Aaron
Yeah, the whole thing with the Confederation of Helpers is like, you know, primarily it's good to help people. You know, that's the whole reason. For this whole political ideology is that people need more help than they're getting in the current society. So trying to find ways to provide that is like a primary goal. But one of the major effects of helping people is people liking you. And if we're talking about the PR war as the first and foremost front. 

Speaker
Go. 

Aaron
Of this intolerance of them trying to crack down on your movement, which it always is, it's always the PR front first. If you want allies at the point when there ever, God forbid, is a actual military crackdown, if you want the people who do have training or weapons or understanding of how to do these things on your side, the main thing you have to be doing before that isn't training for a violent. Right, it's helping people. And I think like in these movements, we have to be like actively pushing against these types of arguments and ideas that we've been discussing here because I think, well, like a lot of the time, they're coming from a well meaning place or a place of sort of despair or a place of. It's going to end up in a fight, and we're gonna have to fight the bad guys, and if we're not prepared enough, we're going to lose when we fight the bad guys. And like, I'm sympathetic to that despair. I understand where it's coming from, but we can't give in to that logic because it's going to harm us in the long run. And at the same time, we have to be aware that, like I hesitate even bringing this up because it's like a weird thing in leftist circles. But it's also a really real thing is that when movements like this start growing and start becoming successful, there are infiltrators in the movement. And one of the main things that they're going to be trying to do. Is pushing the movement towards violence, pushing the movement towards this. The that defense is so necessary that we have to be, like, primarily focused on that. We have to be focused on this conflict. We have to be focused on the time that comes when there's gonna be violence and we have to be prepared for violence. And we have to be preparing for violence constantly. And the reason that. Like, I feel like such a weird even saying this. But like if there's like FBI infiltrators in your movement, that's what they're gonna be saying. And the reason that that's what they're gonna be saying is because they. We know that that's what's going to give them the pretext to do these crackdowns that may come in the future if the PR war doesn't win enough on their end or the legal battles that they're coming at you with win. But like, that's so far down the line that it's like it's not worth talking about. And I don't even want to say it's so far down the line that it's like an inevitable thing that will happen even. Actually, I really don't think it is like we've seen societies change massively over time in ways like not completely getting rid of capitalism. We've never seen the end of capitalism so far since capitalism started, but we've seen massive changes in society that happened without violent revolutions, so I think. Sure. Self-defense is being helpful to. People not being violent, unhinged weirdos and like being hyper aware of the legal system, have lawyers on your side know what you're doing and what your defense is against the state because the 1st way the state is going to come at you is through their own legal system. So like. Knowing. What you're doing? And how it isn't illegal is like a huge a huge aspect of like accounting for the plan. If the state tries to destroy. Movement. 

Shawn
Yeah. So I think in order to have the moral imagination and the moral courage to talk about a realistic transition plan and to bring more people in, we need to have a more realistic idea of what it looks like when the state is going to attack us. It's not going to be some epic conflict, good versus evil. End of a Marvel movie kind of thing. It's going to be pedantic. Little legal codes. It's going to be spreading rumors. It's going to be putting people on the movement who are like, hey, you guys are all cool enough to agree with being violent, right. And then everyone looks around like, well, I want to be cool. Maybe I'll say I want to be violent. No. Avoid that. Like really, really avoid that. I feel I want to pick up on this. I actually think just like second guessing whether I should say this. I think the left on Twitter and stuff. Infiltrated to a high degree already. I think that the things that people say are influenced by people who do not have your best interests at heart, and I think we should be really careful about that desire to fit in and be cool, causing us to not even agree with things that we don't agree with but not speak up about things that we feel are probably dangerous. And probably going to get people in trouble. People probably going to make things harder for us. Not saying that all of this comes from infiltration or whatever, but I'm saying it's a pretty safe bet that some of it does. And if it doesn't come from it directly now it comes from the Co Intel Pro era and it's been reiterated over the years and become common sense in a way that we just we really. 

Aaron
Gotta push it out. Yeah. If there's FBI agents on Twitter pretending to be leftists. Or I'm saying if like there there must be, I don't know. I I sometimes I'm like, I don't know how conspiracy brain now I just I think there is. I doubt that any of them are on Twitter saying, hey guys, maybe we shouldn't ever do anything violent. Maybe we should focus on helping people. Maybe we should be focused on building the sort. Of. Structures of democratic participation that we imagine the future society will have. Maybe we should be focused on. And building a movement that's genuinely attractive to people, a movement that we can gain so much mass support that the military won't stand a chance against it. Not because it is so much more powerful in terms of weapons or guns, but because the force of public opinion is such that it even infiltrates the military. The people in the military are like, ohh, last time I was home when I wasn't on deploy. I meant my mom was telling me about how this library socialist organization was helping her with all this, like gardening tools that she doesn't have. She was able to do this thing that she'd never done before because the Confederation of Helpers was there to help aerate the soil, and they were like, yeah, let's grow. Let's start a community garden in your backyard. I can see you really want to do that. We want to help you with that. It'll be this great thing. We'll work together on it. And like, I don't know if I want to crack down on them. They seem great. Like, that's a more powerful defense against the military crackdown than gunning up. 

Shawn
It's funny because I imagine what people would say to that and but it's. So I just dismiss it all. I I'm not even gonna say it out loud. I know what your arguments are against that. I mean, send us an e-mail if you have a good one, but well, you really think this? Yes, I do really think this. Do you have an argument? You really think that the FBI is trying to incite people to violence so they can justify? Cracking down on you and making leftist ideas less popular to make it impossible to build a large scale movement for social transformation if you. Look at really think they would do that? 

Aaron
You you look at the history of what the FBI did, and that's exactly what they were saying. Yeah, we're always doing, yeah. 

Shawn
100 percent 110. Percent. Let's stop being naive. Let's stop pretending that people who are saying this kind of stuff and criminalizing themselves and encouraging other people to criminalize themselves in a system that's. 

Aaron
Are the ones who aren't naive. Yeah, the ones who just say no. We're just gonna have to fight a civil war against the American military and win. That's the non naive position. 

Shawn
It's morally justified to kill American settlers without any reason or recourse. You guys are so naive. Everyone should say that. No, please shut the **** **. Step away from the microphone and like you're ******* things up for everyone and people gotta stand up to this. It's stupid. It's like I I hate to use the belittling, belittling language of intelligence. I can't think of a better term for it. It's just like it's really, really foolish stuff, guys. It's really, really foolish. You're not impressing anyone either. The like little niche group of like, Twitter friends or whatever. And everyone's, you know, patting each other on the back about how radical you are and want to use an FBI agent. Maybe they say that it's cool. Talk to your mom about it. Talk to your neighbors about it. You're not impressing anyone. You're alienating yourself. You're making the possibility of social transformation more distant, and it's exactly what they would want you to do. The most hostile people in the world want us to. The movement at the fundamental level by getting people way ahead of themselves, getting them overconfident on things that have no practical application to reality, and making it when they hear a message like here's a transitionary strategy that might bring us to a place where we could reasonably have a mass buy in social transition to an ecological and democratic society. They want your reaction to that to be impossible. You need mass death, which is exactly what Jordan Peterson would say. 

Aaron
Here's a transitionary concept for you, sweetie pie, self-defense. 

Shawn
A responsible and rapid transition to an ecological and democratic society is an ethical and political necessity. But activists can sabotage our ability to make that actually happen by making the transition ahead sound like. Hell on Earth, the trenches of war, or an unrelenting factory of trauma. Many aspects of an ecological and democratic revolution are already widely popular or could easily be made popular with the right strain. Energies. But by being undisciplined edge Lords who are more interested in demonstrating how radical we are than actually serving the cause, we can ****** defeat from the jaws of victory and manufacture artificial resistance to good and popular ideas. 

Aaron
The defining feature of a new society is not violence. It is not war. And it is not conflict, it's care. It's. Hair, its decency, humility, hospitality and collaboration. We propose a transition to a new society that is so. Sweetie pie. You can pitch it to your grandma. We guard against self aggrandizing revolutionary bravado, a transitionary care movement will beat a revolutionary bravado movement. Every time if I can't bring my grandma, it's not my. 

Shawn
The prospect of the world deeply changing is, like it or not, to many people frightening because it's not familiar, even if they're ready for that transition, that's frightening. We need to be ready to take care of them, to ease their worries, to onboard them, to something that feels big and exciting and inspiring, not frightening, horrific and deadly. We can't do something where we promise. Perfect utopia down the line as long as we just suffer through a few generations of eating garbage and being torn. It's not going to fly with people. That's how you lose. We need to be realistic to a larger reality. The best self-defense we have is a big movement with a good reputation and a vision of a global revolution that people can actually see themselves being a part of. 

Aaron
Being sweetie pie robs our enemies of their excuse. To be overly aggressive or violently repressive towards us, it puts them in the position of needing to be the first aggressor. This doesn't mean we can guarantee that there will never be conflict, and it doesn't mean we shouldn't be willing to train for more forms of traditional self-defense. But we are best positioned to transform society if we have the discipline to not idealize the use of force to never use more force than is strictly necessary, and to only resort to force when it is strictly necessary. When we talk to people about our values, they'll be glad to hear that we object to the same moral horrors that they object to. And that there are red moral lines that we are simply unwilling to cross. A practice of exhausting all other options before resorting to force is the best self-defense against the most pressing and imminent threats to our movements. 

Shawn
Finally, we'll end here with a quote from Subcomandante Marcos, which we found very inspiring. Our struggle has a code of honor inherited from our gorilla ancestors. And it contains, among other things, respect for civilian lives. 

Aaron
Even though they may occupy government positions that are. S. 

Shawn
We don't use crime to get resources for ourselves. 

Aaron
We don't. Rob's not even a snack store. 

Shawn
We do not respond to words with. 

Aaron
Fire, even though many hurt us or lie to us. 

Shawn
One could think that to renounce these traditionally revolutionary methods is renouncing the advancement of our struggle. But in the faint light of history, it seems that we've advanced more than those that resort to such arguments. 

Aaron
More to demonstrate their radical nature and consequences than to effectively serve their cause. 

Shawn
Our enemies want us to resort to these methods. Unfortunately for them, it's not like this and it never will be. 

Aaron
All right. Next question, is there anywhere where the unity of means and ends may be tested in the pursuit of library socialism? Are there transitionary forms that you can see being useful and applicable under the current society, but which you imagine would eventually need to be abolished? 

Shawn
Yeah. So to answer this question, I want to start by talking a little bit about the means. Men's concept is an important concept in anarchism and we take influence from anarchism. Although library socialist isn't strictly anarchists, I think a lot of anarchists would say that we don't meet their criteria. That's fine with me. So I think means and ends unity. The basic concept right is that you can't achieve ends in One Direction by using means that point in another direction. A classic example would be you can't create peace by war or you can't abolish the state by using the state. That kind of thing. So the way that I think about means and ends is it's sort of like a spectrum. With the spectrum where? The exact ends that we imagine can't really be perfectly aligned with in a pragmatic sense. It can't be perfectly aligned with the means of what we do in our day-to-day like I wake up in a property system that I don't agree with. I wake up in a bed that's manufactured by processes that I don't agree with, and to achieve a perfect means ends unity on everything that 100% means ends. And I'm not saying this to make the concept like incoherent or something like that, but just to point out that there is some finite limit to our capacity to unify means and ends. 

Speaker
Will. 

Shawn
But at the other end of the spectrum, there's things where the means and ends are so fundamentally incompatible that it's like a red line that you can't go past. It just doesn't make sense. It's violating your goal. And so the anarchist critique of, like, statist, communism is typically that they advocate for doing things. That move you further away from the goal of a, you know, a stateless, classless society, and so on, which is also the stated goal of Marxists. So yeah, I I think of it as a spectrum and I think we're always stuck not at the perfect 100% means unity of the spectrum, but we fall somewhere in between. But I agree with that. Those hard red lines of like for example, I want to build a society that nourishes, takes care of and supports the healthy development of child. And and in order to achieve that end, I would not ever cosign killing children to get there. Even if you could create some convoluted scenario where it wasn't necessary, I don't think it's necessary. 

Aaron
Yeah, you can just create a convoluted answer as to how you can get around it and that. 

Shawn
You know, yeah, moral imagination and moral courage, I think, is is what it takes in these kind of situations. Yeah, like that's a red line for me. I could never agree with. Killing a child, I mean, even in self-defense, I think you should avoid it. 

Aaron
The kids coming at you with a knife a little 3 year old. I had to self-defense. 

Shawn
But yeah, so just giving that context the answer. The question like our overall strategy is based on seeking some great degree of means ends unity like we imagine a democratic society and a democratic means to get there. But are there institutional forms that would be useful now that would then be later abolished? I think pretty much all the institutional forms that we've described wouldn't be necessary in a system where this ideology is fully integrated into a complete system like the Confederation of Helpers that we propose exists inevitably within the context of this other system that we have. Merited that we didn't design, yeah. 

Aaron
Whole framing of it is as a thing within the currency. Yeah, yeah. The means and ends question. It sometimes gets framed as means and ends unity, but even people who say that I think have to recognize that yeah, it's like a reductio ad absurdum. You can't you can't teleport to a future library socialist society that doesn't exist as your means to creating it in the current system. It doesn't make any sense. So the idea of means and ends unity to me or the thing. About it that I agree with. Is that? If we want to build a better future, and this is how we envision this better future to look, then the steps that we take to get towards that better future should have the values and the nascent organizational structures of the society that you want to build. Those should be the things that you're basing it off of and and that you're constructing as you're moving in this direction towards the ends that you want to move towards. So like. One of the major violations of means and ends that I really disagree with is the one we talked about for the first large chunk of this episode, which is the idea that like to create a stable, healthy, participatory democratic society, we first need to institute some sort of authoritarian rule. We first need to start a civil war. We first need to participate in mass. Death. We need to take away participation. We have to enforce our ideas on people until they accept them. And then once we have all the power, once we've accumulated the state under our control, then we'll allow it to wither away. That's the sort of Marxist idea of like using the state to 1st gain all the power. Or your idea, your movement and then once you have it, trust me. We're going to turn back, move in the other direction. We're going to start withering it away. It never happens like that in history. It makes no sense that it would happen like that because the movement that you're participating in is building the type of society that you want to move towards. So the steps along the way. Should be steps along the way. There shouldn't be steps in the opposite direction that promise. Trust me, we're going to swing back around after we have all the power. Are there forms that would be useful and applicable under the current society that eventually need to be abolished? Like, yeah, like everything that we do in the current society to move towards that is going to be tainted with the current society which is set up in ways that I really don't agree with. So one of the things I was talking about is a potential type of self-defense. One of the previous questions is interacting with. And making sure that you fit into the legal system of the current society, which has a lot of laws that I really don't agree. Participating in the current society that we currently live in is inherently a violation of means and ends, so I think the way to distinguish between a violation of means and ends that is moving you in the right direction, and one that is moving you in the wrong direction. Is just a simple test of like. Is this thing that we're doing more like the society that we want in the end or less like the society we want in the end? And if it's more like it, then your means are aligning towards your ends, you're moving in the right direction. The other core part of that is like, yeah, there's red lines. We shouldn't be killing. Children, we shouldn't be advocating for systematically suppressing the voices of certain people within the society. We should be. Talking about building a genuinely democratic participatory world, and not just talking about it actually doing it. One metaphor that I think is really useful and powerful in the realm of means and ends is planting seeds. Because the seed is not the same thing as the flower, but which seeds you plant, determine which flowers grow or which plants grow. If you're growing food or. Or whatever the stretch the metaphor. But you can't just plant any seed you want and expect it to grow into whatever you want. But at the same time, you can't expect to just have a fully formed flower appear out of nowhere because you've desire it, or because you point a gun at the grass or whatever. 

Shawn
Yeah, yeah, but no, that it makes a lot of sense, like it summarizes really well, I think like qualitative differences between like a total indifference to means and ends versus like an unrealistic idea of means and ends of like, you're just going to have flowers right away. It's like, no, you have a seed. And then there's all these steps, but the right seed at the right time is what leads to the flower. What you want? 

Aaron
Yeah. And like the seeds and the flowers are connected, the means and the hands are connected. Certain means are going to get you towards certain end. Like you can't. 

Shawn
The ends are like the same way. The flowers in the seed. The ends are contained within the means, but the means and the ends aren't synonymous necessarily. 

Aaron
They're contingent, yeah. That's not completely overlapping Venn diagram. 

Shawn
No, I think that's a beautiful metaphor and it it it it gets to this subtle kind of thing that we're trying to talk about here, this the challenge of means and ends. Of of respecting, respecting the value of it, but also without leaving the door open to an absurd misinterpretation or something like that. 

Aaron
Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to the reductio ad absurdum of like you have to start at the place you're trying to go to. 

Speaker
2. 

Shawn
Another question along these lines responding to our first episode. At various points you layout approaches where you cooperate or even give de facto legal ownership to municipal governments. However, this seems to make it easy for the state to requisition these assets if they ever choose to suppress the movement. Conversely, if the state maintains these agreements, how can we be sure this does not lead to these libraries? Socialist organizations, becoming supporters of state. Power, in other words, how is cooperation with municipal governments not a violation of the unity of means and ends? So I'm going to respond to that last point first. Then we can talk about it more broadly. So in an ideal society, you would have fair institutions that are governed by sort of charters and bylaws that are ethical and are connected to, you know, and. Ecological and democratic society. Very different institutions than the one we had. And it would be right and part of those ends for people to participate in those institutions in a proportionate way, not ruling over others but participating in a democratic process, advocating for themselves in their position and so on, in a way that's collaborative and gives due deference to other people. I think there actually can be a unity of means and ends and I think I think anarchy like a lot of anarchists will object to this and fair enough. Feel free to criticize the idea, hopefully in its substance. So I think there actually is a type of unity between means and ends. Where if we're approaching existing institutions which we don't agree with the structure, scale, scope and so on of, but we're approaching them with the disposition that one should be approaching the institutions of a desirable society. Not perfect. Unity of means and ends, because those institutions don't exist, so you can't act the same way towards them current institutions as you would them in a perfect sense. But I think there is actually a type of unity of means and ends where you can participate in existing institutions as long as you're functioning according to. 

Speaker
The. 

Shawn
Principles of a desirable society, which is that you're engaging in a collaborative democratic process that you're advocating for and pushing for things that are consistent with the type of society that you want. Create and you're not taking up sort of more than your fair share of the political realm dominating other people and so on. So I think there is a a type of consistency, maybe not everyone will agree with that, but it it makes sense to me. I've always sort of. 

Aaron
Felt that way. Yeah, I don't know when I think about interacting with, especially municipal governments, because I think they're the most. Liable through direct organizing work, you know the the numbers involved in elections and creating a voting bloc that can make changes is much smaller than it is in federal or provincial levels. So I think there's a lot of potential benefit for interacting with municipal institutions and making them more like the institutions that we'd like to see on municipal level. In the future society that we want to move towards, so like to me there's a the unity of means and ends, for this is at least partially the idea that we're changing the current existing institutions as both a proof of concept for like things can be more in this direction and function giving people experience for interacting with institutions that. Like if we had a municipal library system. Them that massively expanded to provide a whole bunch of different things for people, and they have de facto legal ownership in that situation. But there's a system that exists within the city where people are like, oh, I no longer have to buy all these different types of goods, they can just take them out at the library and they have that experiential knowledge of what it's like. To live in a system where these goods and services are provided to you for free through a library. Them to me that is moving in the right direction. That's a type of unity of means and ends that's using the means of creating a smaller version of the society that you want to create, in this instance, using the municipal government as the sort of platform for that. I guess in theory. That makes it easier for the state to requisition those assets like. 

Shawn
I don't agree with. 

Aaron
That actually I can see the argument for that. I don't know what like are we talking about? The federal government, I guess in this case. 

Speaker
Hi. 

Aaron
Federal governments can't just requisition anything they want from municipal governments like depends what country you're in. There's different, like legal precedents and stuff. But this is a complex, thorny legal issue. Anytime you're dealing with legal ownership within the current system, you're playing on their turf, and there's the possibility that maybe they're going to. Try and crack down on you legally and seize these assets for some reason or whatever. 

Shawn
I don't think it's the case. Like I'll explain why it's not the case that having a municipal library makes it easier for, say, some hostile government entities to seize and shut down your project than if it weren't a collaboration. With the municipal government, because it's actually pretty easy in either circumstance for them to, you know, if we have this hostile group that's using the power of the law and the authority of of. 

Aaron
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. It's like it's like maybe marginally easier. I don't know enough about the law to say that, but it just doesn't seem like if they're just dead set on. 

Shawn
Existing governments. 

Aaron
It I don't think that's gonna be the. 

Shawn
Yeah, it just it's just straight up. In our first episode, we talked about a few different possibilities of, you know, fronts that we could push on and and the municipality, you know, like existing libraries like. So think about the libraries in your city like they're cool people like them. And when people want to cut funding to them, it costs them at the ballot box, you know, like, because people like them, it doesn't make it. Well, we should have our own independent kind of like anarchist libraries to prevent the ability of the government to crack down on it. Like obviously we see that as an incoherent in that. Context, but it actually being integrated into existing systems with varying degrees of ideological overlap is a a potential strength, because in order to be implemented, you need to have people who are sympathetic within positions of power the way that the power system works is that people are appealing to the public. Through elections. And there could be conflicts over these institutions and stuff like that, and it's totally possible. But. If you're completely outside of the system and then you have a state coming in to crack down on something, then there's no guarantee that you have sympathizers inside. You have no political parties or units or whatever that are associated with the benefits of this thing. And we're talking about something that would be really popular and that people would really like because it's effective and it's functional. It's it's cheap on. Yeah. It's it's not scary. It's not like some Stalinist bloodthirst thing. It's just like regular common sense, like, make life better. ****. That's our slogan here at library. So there's not some stalling, this blood thirst thing. It's just common sense. Make life better ****. So you have people who are within institutions. As long as these institutions of power exist in their current form, who are going to bat for the thing now, and that's not to say that it's impossible that you could backslide. Have benefits that come and then are withdrawn and so on. But that's just part of the territory of any sort of political or social change inside or outside of systems. Being able to like kind of articulate every detail of every contingency of every possible thing that could ever possibly happen, and satisfying every member of the entire public, isn't how any political movement has. Worked, but the the possibility of there being a backsliding of something isn't an argument about attempting to sort of forward slide on it, and we've got a lot of reason to think that if you move forward on this stuff that you could get a type of momentum, you could get a type of support and like, yeah, there could be challenges, some back and forth on it. World isn't simple. Social transformation isn't simple, but. 

Speaker
The. 

Shawn
I just think it's just straightforwardly not true that being integrated into like a municipal library system makes you more at risk than the alternative of being totally independent and anarchic. I just, I just reject that it doesn't make sense. 

Aaron
To me, yeah, if we wanna build a new dual power system that eventually is able to replace the current. Liberal democracy system that we have set up the CAP. List hierarchical pseudo democracy of our current society. First, infiltrating and changing, especially on the local level, the municipal level, changing those institutions to be more like the institutions that we want society at the end to be like to me makes it easier for those institutions to be. Integrated into the new system as it's built to become part of the democratic no longer counter power, but actual power of the confederated systems of. Councils to me, it's not making it easier for the state to commandeer it by making it more like the thing that we want. It's making it easier for it to be a genuine part of the transition of what we're moving towards and like. 

Shawn
Yeah, there's not going to be a Thunder clap moment where you go from one to like, historians who talked about the advent of capitalism. There's no Thunder clap moment where all of a sudden capitalism. It's like the the the tendrils of the things that would become capitalism became ever more present and feudalism, and then eventually the things that were feudalism fade and then capitalism becomes the main thing. 

Aaron
Right. Exactly. Yeah. And it's like, yeah, it's not like we have to build all new libraries and be like, this is the anarchist library. It's beside the old other library. And we're going to tear down the building of the old other library after we've competed them out of existence. We will take the books out and then blow it up because that building. 

Shawn
You have that filthy capitalist library. 

Aaron
Thing that that was in, that's part of the old system and it's infected with the state and it's bad and it's like, I understand that there are risks of ideological capture if you're interacting too much with current political systems and we will get into that more as we're moving up in questions. It's like there's a real risk in radical politics of becoming. Sort of. Meshed in all the garbage of the current system and so like I understand the hesitancy to want to interact too much or to put too many eggs in the basket of the current municipal government system. There's there's imperfections there and there's there's risks that we need to be aware of and in certain situations it might be better to create a. Completely outside institution. Maybe not for like building a new library and making copies of all the books and having our own separate one beside it, but in for other aspects of the system you probably don't want to just be trying to commandeer municipal governments, but to be building a separate thing aside it. But I I don't think that's like a hard and fast thing that we have to be completely protecting against any interaction with current municipal governments, we can't be utilizing them in any way. We can't be changing them to be more like the thing that we want them to be in the future society. I think that's just self defeating. 

Shawn
Yeah, it's kind of like this is, this is probably not the person who asked this question, probably object to me. Saying this, but it does kind of remind me to being like, well, if you break a bone and then you go to the hospital, aren't you kind of risking that people are going to start supporting? I'm thinking this in the Canadian context. We have state funded hospitals and free health. There, which is great, I recommend it. I mean, it's not that great, but it's much, much better than the alternative. Yeah. Like if you go to the hospital with a broken bone and they stitch you up, like, won't that risk making people support the government more? And it's well, maybe. But you have a ******* broken bone, man. Like, like you saying that the only way that we can deal with a broken bone is by creating some. Anarchist counter hospital. And that like and that's the way that we make sure that people don't support the state more sometimes, like there's there's there's ideological debates and discussions that we can have with people about the limits of the power of the state and. Go on. But like my primary concern, in transitioning to an ecological and democratic society isn't whether a great municipal library of things might make people support their city more. It seems mostly fine. It's whether or not we can ever achieve a political and social change in our society with all these forces working again. 

Aaron
Yeah. And I mean, yeah, and if you're at the point where your municipality has been significantly altered such that you have, like a real, genuine sort of local library system and you're worried about the federal government coming in and commandeering that because they see it as a threat to the state power on the federal level, that is like. I don't. I almost don't even want to grant that. That's like a likely situation, because I don't think it is really a likely situation. But to me that is like a recipe for getting people to disagree with the state even more and wanting the municipality to break off from the state or wanting to. If they would. Fight back against that legally and like it's highly unlikely the government's going to be like sending in the military to commandeer the libraries. So I don't see that turning into a violent thing necessarily. They would be trying to do this through some convoluted legal means. And like, if the federal government did try to do that, that's just laying bare. The the. 

Shawn
Moral emptiness of their side. If they were trying to do that, yeah. And then, and that's in the context where people have already experienced the abundance of this kind of system and way of thinking first hand. So you're not. You're not just. Fighting against these ideas, you're taking something away from people who are used to having something that they appreciate. It's a really powerful position if if that's the worst problem that we face, we're going to win. Yeah. On the subject of preventing backsliding or like the next, government wants to withdraw the stuff or whatever. Another thing that you can do is set up legally and you have to work with lawyers and policy utopian policy from below type stuff. But you can set up in the legislation or the organizational charters and stuff for these, these libraries of things. Things that make it harder to just like scrap something for parts so you can set disillusion requirements like. Require for example, all the people who are members of the organization to agree to it being closed down like some impossible high standard or as close to that as you can get away with. You can also set other dissolution requirements saying like if this is going to be shut down, it needs to be passed off to community groups or even specific community groups XY and Z or it needs to have the potential for the. The users of it to take over. For it like the the you can't sell it for parts like it's like sometimes you'll have something like a first sale doctrine or first offer doctrine. I can't remember how it's worded in law, right, but it's like if this is going to be sold, that needs to be offered for sale to this person first. Then you could do that with like, the Members of this library get the first chance to take it over. If the state is, if the municipality is no longer going to support it. So you can write stuff like that into this founding documents to make it like pulling teeth. To actually like get rid of it or sell it off and protect against these type of things. And it requires imagination and and so on. But it's it's totally plausible. 

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah. And I think too, like another sort of utopian policy idea we've talked about before that is relevant here, that I don't know if you could implement this on the municipal level, would probably be more of a federal thing. But as a way of like wanting to protect things that are donated to a library system from somehow being yeah, like stripped down and sold off or parts or privatized or something. We've talked before about the idea of creating a new class of property, like an explicitly use of fraction class of property where. Items that are part of the library are in the Commons, and once something has been signed over into the. Commons then it stays there or there's, like, really specific strictures in place on how something could ever be sold back out of the Commons into private ownership once again. But I like the idea of it kind of being like a one way path where, like, if you don't need something anymore, you can sign it over to the library system and be sure that. It will from then on forward be part of the library system. Legally, it is now no longer allowed to be part of the traditional abuses property system. It has now been signed over into the use of Rachian Commons, and that's where it will stay until. Breaks down or as it goes through cycles of repair and whatnot, depending on what the item is. 

Shawn
Yeah. And like, if if the municipal library is going to shut down, then the only like, it's literally illegal for them to try to sell it, they can only transfer it to other libraries that meet certain criteria or whatever and. 

Speaker
Right. 

Shawn
And yeah, like there's all sorts of complex stuff that would go into actually doing that, but it's not beyond the realm of possibility to to consider when we're talking about a real serious long term transition. And I think another thing that just generally beneficial it connects into both those things. But I think legal. Real legal structures of like democratization and making these bodies participatory and like you can set up in law that, for example, like police boards manage themselves and like we had this controversy here in Vancouver of like our City Council couldn't actually stop the police board from doing something. Because the police board technically had by law agency. That the City Council couldn't like overstep, they had to negotiate with them. So you can set up structures of like these independent bodies, these semi independent bodies that are state funded but have their own agency. And you can do that in a way that the agency is distributed to the members of the organization or the community distribute the power, give it to the Community and that can all be legally. 

Aaron
Right. 

Shawn
Reinforced and like legally binding. Yeah. So it's it. It's possible for those sort of things to be undone. And there's a million different ways that unpredictable can't get into every detail. Of like ways that people who are trying to mess with a movement for human liberation, for social liberation, could try to backslide stuff. So don't claim that we figured everything out here, but at the very least, like, those are some promising steps of how to make it harder to make sure that if they want to drag back, if they want to pull back wins and successes we have. At the very least, we're going to go kicking and screaming and we're going to make it hard for them. Here's another transitionary concept for you, Bugs Bunny, the bourgeoisie. 

Aaron
There are people who will, as our movements grow, work to undermine US, crush us, and crack down on us. While it might be an appealing fantasy to imagine a final showdown like a movie climax where it comes to blows and the righteous. Overcome the wicked that is not likely to be the road ahead. We need a new map of how these conflicts might unfold. A new metaphor, a story we can tell ourselves. We're talking, of course, about Bugs Bunny as a revolutionary verb. We're going to Bugs Bunny, the people who try to crush our movements. 

Shawn
We believe it is possible and necessary to outsmart the enemies of free society. Instead of out muscling them, we will outwit them, will rally large groups of people, will make fun of them. We'll paint the wall as a tunnel and they'll run into it. We'll hit them in the face with pies. We'll use their own aggression against the. We'll make them run off a Cliff and hold up a sign that says Yikes before they plummet down from their own hubris, we'll dress up as a woman and trick them into kissing us. We'll pull their pants down and reveal their heart pattern underwear in front of the whole school. We'll mug for the audience with a mischievous smirk. Ain't I a stinker? 

Aaron
Our metaphor here is playful, but we're serious about the practicality of this advice. There are sometimes better ways to win than playing strength against strength. Something strong can also be brittle. Sometimes it can be preferable to be ready to bend. We can move like water, bounce like Jello, crawl through cracks like slime mold. Sometimes something soft can beat something strong. Paper Beats rock over. Seriousness can make us snap like a twig. 

Shawn
We have a large list of tools at our disposal which can help us deal with external threats that are not just being the strongest trickery, faint softness and innocence, feigned unseriousness, running and hiding, cracking wise, doing the unexpected, we can use the force of the enemy against them by dropping a banana peel in their path. Turning them against each other, or sometimes even simply stepping out of the way at the right. 

Aaron
Time, humor, and irreverence. Our assets we can train in the defensive art of gestures, privilege, which is the best defense we have against PR crisis, bad reputation and sabot. They will slander us, pretend to be us and make us look bad and try to make people think we're dangerous. That's what we need to defend ourselves against. We'll make sure that everyone is in on the joke except them. If we Bugs Bunny on them, social revolution will be a cakewalk. Next question and we got a few variations on this one. The question is why don't you two found or start a library socialist political party in Canada? Party politics sucks, but I'm sure there's a way to make it more interesting through councils and popular assemblies. So yeah, why don't you start a political party? I don't know. I'd say for me like that sounds like a nightmare part the idea of interacting with the party politics. Fear in any way more than like a toss in a vote to whoever. There's the best is like I have no interest in that. It's like everything Sean's told me about his experiences in it and everything I see. Like I just don't want to. 

Shawn
Yeah, we'll we'll have to talk about this in more depth at a later date, sort of an analysis of the electoral system and stuff. But I've got experience both. I was a minor party leader in the early twenty 10s. The Pirate Party of Canada, and then later I was a campaign manager, voter contact organizer for a Social Democratic Party. So I've got some relevant experience here, sufficient enough to say that I don't want. To do this. Definitely at this time and probably in general, but. 

Aaron
Yeah. And also we're doing the podcast and like running a political party would be like a a large. It would take a large time commitment. Sean's got a new baby. I don't think you can add political party onto your plate at the moment even if you. 

Shawn
Wanted to. Yeah. So in general. I don't think we oppose the idea of people making new political parties. Third, political parties, even political parties that have influence from the library, socialist sphere. In fact, we'd hope that all political parties in the world eventually take influence. From the sphere. 

Aaron
Right library, socialist and left library, socialist and. Like argue over like my new details of deadlines and. Waiting lists and whatever. 

Shawn
Yeah, I I think it's important to emphasize, you know, making a political party, a political organization like that is not anything close to a first step. It's not even a second step or a third step. And then, like, we're open to, we've talked about in previous episodes. About the sphere of like institutional politics, prefigurative and narrative work, and a complementary political practice all playing off of each other in beneficial ways, and within that could be political parties, either sort of like entryism and like the major. Political parties that win are creating third parties, especially the municipal level. It's a lot easier to break in, open to that possibilities as long as it's working as part of a complementary hole. But it's not first steps, it's not second steps. It's it's way down the line and we don't. There's a few things I don't want to risk. I don't want to risk peoples first exposure to library of socialism. Being a political party that's seeking their vote, because then if they're committed to another party, like a lot of people have family ties to parties and stuff like that. That, like my family's, always voted conservative or whatever. Then you were casting yourselves as a 0 sum enemy against them, and we want to really build a mass movement. And the other thing is that the we don't want to put forward political party as a leader of a movement. And I think political parties have that tendency to try to deputize themselves. As leader. 

Aaron
Yeah. 

Shawn
And base the world around their electoral considerations instead of around the world itself. And we want a mass movement to be leading any sort of institutional form, like a political party, not, not vice versa. 

Aaron
Yeah, I think the sphere of electoral politics as it exists right now is like it's filled with a lot of double binds and it's filled with a lot of. Forces that are going to put pressure on people who participate in it to compromise their values in order to. Play the game of the system or try and get elected, or even like spending the time that it takes to keep a political party registered and going around door knocking to get people to sign up. I I you have to get like a certain amount of Members and things to actually be a political party. There's a lot of like things that I think if this was the sort of primary. The strategy someone was taking to try and push for library socialism. There's gonna be motivations put into the group. It's going to put pressures on the group to shape the organization in the mold of the current electoral system rather than having the organization be shaped towards the sort of goals of and the organizational structural basis for like an actual library. Socialist movement. So. Yeah, I I could see a lot of beneficial roles for like a third party at some point in the future or like, if someone's like, super stoked on the idea of starting a political party and that's where you feel like you want to put your energy, not saying, you know, never do that or you're horrible for wanting to do that, it could be useful. Like, I don't think I'm the final say on any of this, but it doesn't seem to me like it would be the best place to. And it doesn't seem to me like it was. Be good place to like. Yeah, Sean is saying center your movement around a political party in the current democratic system because one of the main reasons for needing a change in the current political system is how corrupt and how corrupting the current electoral party politics system is. And. 

Speaker
I. 

Aaron
So I'd just be would be very wary about entering into that sphere and thinking that you're gonna be able. To maintain your values while trying to be like a real player in that sphere. 

Shawn
Yeah. And I think the library socialism, you know, we talked a little bit about, you know, the library has all these different books in it. It's bigger than the sum of its parts. And the differences aren't generative. You know, the cooperative difference is generative and political. Parties have this sort of implicit logic of like. Now we've got the right flag, the right color, the right guys, and we're going to be in charge and we're going to do it right. I I want to distance ourselves from that way of thinking about politics in favor of a a much more holistic, polycentric approach, you know. But I mean on one front, and there's a little anecdote that I was just reminded of recently that I found mind-blowing, that speaks to the power of complementarity between different types and different strategies at once. Which is. By some quirk of history, you can look this up. In 1981, Bernie Sanders was elected to as mayor for the first time in Burlington, Vt. He was elected mayor by 10 votes, 10 tiny votes. Enough. You know, you could fit 10 people in a room, 10 votes made the difference between him being mayor or the, you know, Democratic insider shell. I mean, I don't know if he was a good guy or not, but anyways Bernie want. And in that election none other than Murray Bookchin. And his little cadre of anarchists decided that they were going to be voting for Bernie. They don't, you know, the. They're they're not big on elections. They're not big on that sort of stuff. They're more in the prefigurative direct democracy sphere. But they're like, hey, well, this guy says radical stuff and he's different than the other guys. So we're going to put our support behind him. So when he won by 10 votes, Murray Bookchin was like, I know, those 10 people. So by some crazy twist of history, Bernie Sanders political career and earnest that has extended for. And since he was able to be elected by the support of generally non voting anarchists deciding to vote for him one time, just an interesting little example of how these very different strategies when they align and work together can cause really powerful things, and unfortunately they felt like Bernie didn't return the favor down the road and it was a little bit of a bitter. Anti Bernie thing that came up overtime, but we propose a system where we find a deeper complementarity across these things. 

Aaron
Yeah. And I think another aspect of this is that like in the first episode, we talked about how, you know, being a library socialist doesn't necessarily mean you can't also see yourself as a Marxist or an anarchist or a Social Democrat or like these labels don't have to be exclusionary to other labels and likewise. 

Speaker
But. 

Aaron
With groups and forming groups like, you can be a library socialist who's in a group that's explicitly library socialist and is trying to. Put these exact strategies that we've talked about in these episodes into effect, where you can be a library socialist who's proposing library socialist ideas in an activist group that already exists in a place that has Marxists and anarchists in it, or other people like it doesn't have to be this thing where you're necessarily raising the library. Socialist flag and saying we're a library Socialist Party or we're a library socialist activist group. It can be a thing where library socialist ideas, hopefully what we would hope for would. To be integrated into all sorts of different activist organizations, NGOs, existing political parties, new political parties, dual power organizations that exist completely outside of anything currently in the legal framework, there's a benefit to taking this multiplicity of strategies approach. And to seeing library socialism as a train of thought that can be integrated into many different organizations and layers of society. 

Shawn
So yeah, next question here. While I agree with a lot in the first transition Q&A, I disagree on a core concept. Isn't it true that a dual power strategy cannot succeed on its own and it must be coupled with an effort to seize and wield state power? We got that on Twitter and it's actually just a comment, but I rephrase it as a question because I wanted to talk about it. They didn't say, isn't it true? They just said this is true, right? 

Aaron
Just this is my opinion. 

Shawn
Yeah, which is cool. Actually, I really and I'll say general. Positive feedback is great. Negative feedback is great. It's all really stimulating and like keep it coming, you know, like I'm I. If you disagree, I'd love to hear it because this is what I think you know, is what we think. So hearing challenges to it that are stimulating helps. Figure stuff out, you know. But yeah, so first on this, I partially agree in the sense that when we're talking about a global revolution to a new society on a short time frame and an ecological crisis and so on, the social and ecological crisis that we've. Merited if we want to talk about a global transition, that is sufficient to meet our environmental targets and stuff like that from where I'm sitting. And I'd be curious if people disagree, but from where I'm sitting with the time frame we have and stuff, I'm not sure that we can do that without using all powers available. Corporate power, state power, etcetera. Anything that we've inherited where there's a power. Structure and power system that needs to be making decisions at the very least, we need to be influencing. That and like I don't want to shout out the idea that there could be times and places or contexts as part of a complex mosaic where people can completely withdraw from it and, you know, have a community that is entirely dual power oriented and isn't focused at all on trying to influence outside things like there might be room for that in certain places at certain times. But even those places. You know they have to contend with and be aware of at very minimum. Like are they being criminalized? Are they being cracked down on and so? So on so they have some relationship to state power. 

Aaron
Yeah, forming a dual power organization within the context of the current society. Yeah. You're always going to be, to some extent interacting with existing state power and like pretty much every square inch of the planet with maybe a few exceptions is ruled by some state. Or another. So anywhere that you're building a dual power organization, you're going to be interacting with some state or another. So I don't think that it's mutually exclusive with trying to influence the wielding of state power. I think that would be part of a dual power situation in. Most instances and the extent to which that's true and the means by which you attempt to influence or maybe season, wields. Those aren't words that I would necessarily go for in most instances, because I don't. Like, if you're talking about, you know, where it's 20 years down the line, library socialism movement is huge. Someone has started a third party and it's gaining traction. It wins an election. That's that's a type of seizing state power, I guess. Maybe it's wielding it, but I don't know. I just don't think about it in those terms necessarily. I think organizations that currently have power can be influenced in a variety of ways. And like you mentioned, it's not just state power like corporate power is a huge part of what's currently like sort of like running the. Show and I think we have to be open to all of those avenues of like affecting the actual real world politics of what decisions are being made in terms of the planet. Right now. 

Shawn
Yeah. And I think this kind of connects with the thing I was saying before of like the single good party being in charge fixes the problems mythology, which I just don't think actually like in practice. You can look around even the best option on the ballot usually sucks in some ways, and the best states are like the best parties that have seized power and stuff. They suck in some ways. And like there's just, there's a real benefit in the mutual multiple perspectives. Polycentric balance of power between multiple centers of agency. So one of the like I think well it's possible that there could be a a good library socialist type party that takes over a city or or it takes over a parliament or whatever through either elections or I don't know if there's some sort of crazy civil war scenario. I can't imagine and. 

Aaron
There's some the library socialist faction. Yeah, like Bolshevik style. Overthrows that seizes state, power, and. It's probably not. 

Shawn
Yeah, I mean, but if if, if fate Deans it so I'm not saying like, oh, we'll let the other guys win or whatever if that if that scenario arises. 

Aaron
Good after that mate. But yeah, I mean, like if they did like now, sorry, now I'm getting too into this hypothetical, but the idea of seizing and wielding state power is also like kind of antithetical to. My values like maybe like if you have somehow ended up in some situation where you've seized state power you want to start devolving that power back into democratic structures and giving the power to the people like state power in and of itself I think is a problem that needs to be solved. On a long term basis and well, that doesn't, I don't think you can just eliminate it with like a snap of the finger by seizing and ****, it's gone. We've seized it and now we're eliminating it. I think that. A sort of. Call like you want to be both influencing the decisions of people who have power while also reclaiming power from them and taking it back into institutions that are set up in a more democratic and genuinely participatory way. 

Shawn
Yeah. And it's the same with winning an election or seizing on a coup or whatever. It it always has to devolve. It always needs to be dissolved into, you know, decentralization of power is is just an essential component of a. Democratic and ecological society. It's essential. It's an essential component of the library. Socialist vision of the society we're heading towards. And I think actually to think about how we envision this transition happening and to what degree we wield power or etcetera, it might be beneficial to look at this through the lens of means and ends in a different way. Than we've talked about before. So the world that we want to create is a world where people are free, they have their basic needs met, polycentric. There is a plurality of opinions and positions. There's an interlocking, you know, under our capitalist liberal democracy, we've got a really complex system of, like, layers of bureaucracy. 

Speaker
It's. 

Shawn
Whose jurisdiction things are in, like overlap in different ways, and firms are following laws that are set by municipalities at one level, state at one level, federal at another level, and they're all governed by a system of like judges and courts, and so on. So there's this whole, like, really complex. It's almost too complex to explain how the real world acts. Works and we envision in a library socialist society that will probably have something at least as complicated as that, except it's going to be oriented around democracy, egalitarianism, people's basic needs being met, and so on. So in terms of complexity, there's not necessarily a change. It's not about figuring out the simple version of what can replace this. It's about figuring what the ethical version of complex systems. Might look like. But everyone's voice and participation is respected. There's universal education and training. We respect our place in ecology and provide for everyone's needs of the highest degree possible. And also we got this notion of social complementarity instead of hierarchy. So there's cooperative differences. People's differences are generative. We don't have this concept of above and below better than we're soaking through every aspect of our society. Everything is, you know, practical parts of a comprehensive whole that's bigger than the sum of its parts. And that's the vision of library socialism. As a whole, so looking at that as the ends and thinking about how does that translate to means this is a, this is a concept I've been thinking about that I've been struggling to put into words. I think what we have in front of us is not everything being oriented around a single thing, a single flag, a single organization that's seizing power using it, right. What we're looking at in terms of transition is a complex, interdependent system of people doing different things for their own reasons in a way that benefits the overall system and a complementary kind of ecosystem of tactics organizations and transitionary measures. And there's a role for, you know, some people are going to make their own political party. Some people are going to join existing political parties, other people are going to avoid. Political parties all together. In the helper groups, some people are going to focus on people who need help the most. Some people are going to focus on the people who it's most helpful to like us. Some people are going to focus on their neighborhoods. Some people are going to focus on around the world and all these different things and all these different ways that people freely thinking through and working towards what they want and our vision, all these things. Create a kind of complementary holistic hole that's almost beyond description, you know, and there's also the stuff of like, it just matters of conscience. Like there there, there's there could be someone who inherits their dad's business, a multi billion. Type and he just he has a moment of clarity where he recognizes or she recognizes that what's needed. Is to change the way that things are are working and they put their resources towards helping other groups and like that is in a democratic process that is straightforwardly an authoritarian, capitalist process. But at the same time, we can't shut the door to opportunities like that as they arise. So we have a complex, multifaceted polycentric system of transformation. The. A shoes description in some ways, but we can get the broad strokes of it, which is that people's conscience is important, their morale is important. We can work to. Whether we can be different, we can work differently and alongside each other towards different ends. We can work apart towards the same ends. So our vision of transition is also complex, layered internally differentiated and you know it's as complex as the real world, which is almost too complex to describe. 

Aaron
Yeah, there's no single. Revolutionary moment where the one single library socialist flag waving political group is going to seize power and then be like it's library socialism. Now it's started like that's not how political change ever actually. Happens and it's not how we envision or think that a library socialist future could be genuinely like brought into being. 

Shawn
But there there could be something too. It's like you could have a scenario where in a certain place conditions get so bad where like a very traditional guerrilla group is. Able to get mass support from the population. And have a straightforward fight against, like political authorities and the military and police, and then take territory and stuff like like, that's possible. And places and times throughout history you can see that happening. And like, if that did happen, then we would want to, as the stasis of whatever organization takes this place, then we want to influence them and we we can be agnostic. And how they got there the same way that we're. Stick on the you know, inherited parliaments and stuff that are founded on this horrific violence, you know, 200 years back or whatever and continuing violence to this day. But like what we're looking at is the values and the dissolution of power and the working towards an ecological and democratic society that transforms the world. So it's. We say this not to finger wag, and this way is right and this way this way is wrong. But generally this internal differentiation working towards the same end towards the same value as and towards the goal of a global ecological democratic transition or revolution. Is is what we're. That's our holistic vision for this. 

Aaron
Yeah. So yeah, state power would play some role in that in various ways, but I don't think it's like, yeah, the single one thing. 

Shawn
Yeah, you gotta start with the seeds. You know, you gotta. With the seeds to get the saplings to grow the plant and have the flowers bloom, you can't make a flower bloom by the barrel. 

Aaron
Right. 

Shawn
Of a gun. 

Aaron
Unless, unless it's like a water gun that you spray the ground with every day for a little bit of water. 

Shawn
Yeah. 

Aaron
Water pistol anyway, maybe. 

Shawn
Developments and library socialist theories. 

Aaron
Replace all guns with water guns to water seeds with. 

Shawn
Here's a transitionary concept for you, a complementary cascade of moral imagination which responsibly supersedes our inherited situation in favor of an ecological and democratic society for all. 

Aaron
The world we want to create is a pluralistic and free 1A world where people freely express their conscience, debate, work through disagreements, and sometimes work together. Despite those disagreements, just the same through our transition, people in different positions, jobs, and proclivities will have different roles. Play. There's some small part to play for every person in every position and experience and ability at every stage, from seed to sapling to flower. Our library socialist revolution includes you. 

Shawn
There is no one right way, no single flag that we can wave that will fix the problems that we face. No single group will rule the transition. No single moment will revolutionize the world by Thunder clap the real transition to an ecological and democratic society. A library, socialist commune of communes where everyone is paid according to need, will be polycentric, diffuse, holistic, unpredictable and diverse. Many different people and many different groups will walk many different paths towards building our shared global transition for the future of humanity and our great grandchildren like a library or an ecology, our revolution will be more than the sum of. 

Aaron
Its parts we can't predict and shouldn't predict the way that this will all unfold. Too specific of a planned trajectory is imagination limiting, and perhaps even a tactical mistake, but we can envision an outline of what's possible. We can Co create moral and political principles that can guide us while we remain adaptive to changing circumstances and the needs of the. Moment, we can keep our door open to interventions across the spectrum from a variety of places and contacts, and envision them threaded together in an unpredictable braid through. A complementary cascade brings us closer and closer to the world we have in our hearts. A truly free society, a world which respects every voice and our place in nature without slavery or coercion, cruelty or deprivation, or the crushing mythology of hierarchy. Not just any revolution, but the right revolution at the right time for the right reasons. 

Shawn
We can't and shouldn't predict the future, but what we can control is the seeds of our movement, the soil we nourish it with the environment we use to facilitate the development of our seedlings. We can pick the right seeds to make the right flowers bloom, and together we can create the free and joyous world we desire and create and recreate it season after season. With knowledge and respect and hospitality and compassion at every step. Until one day everything has changed and we look back at today and we tell ourselves I can't believe we used to live like. That. 

Aaron
As David Graeber said, the obvious question is how direct action can contribute to an overall strategy. One that should lead a cumulative movement towards a world without States and capitalism. Here no one is completely sure. Most assume the process could only be one of endless improvisation, insurrectionary moments. There will certainly be likely is not quite a few of them, but they will most likely be one element in a far more complex and multifaceted revolutionary process whose outlines. Could hardly at this point be fully anticipated. 

Shawn
And as Richard Rorty said. Nowadays, to say that we are clever animals is not to say something philosophical and pessimistic, but something political and hopeful. Namely, if we can work together, we can make ourselves into whatever we are clever and courageous enough to imagine ourselves becoming. This is to set aside Conn's question. What is man and to substitute the question what sort of world? And we prepare for our great grandchildren. So yeah, that's our second Q&A on transitionary questions. It was a, it was a fun one. I hope you had fun. A lot of these questions are ones that require a lot of unpacking, doubling back and like just, there's a lot of weird implications in the discourse around this kind of stuff. I'm curious what you thought of it. There's a little bit of a. I've got a little bit of like nervousness saying things that I know I've seen people get eviscerated on the Internet for saying. But I mean, and we said in a more interesting way, right. And also when people are eviscerated for saying this kind of stuff, they never actually address their arguments, they just insult them personally. So we invite any sort of feedback or personal insults down in the comments section. Here on Patreon. Thanks for being a donor and supporter. It makes a big difference to us, so we can keep thinking through stuff and and I don't know, I know that this kind of what we're describing kind of breaks and is distinct from every other main tendency that I've heard of, even sub tendencies of tendencies or it's different. And that's because we developed it through thinking stuff through ourselves over the last 10 years and just try to avoid saying what we think people want us to say and tried to say what we really thought. So history shall decide whether we'll be rewarded or punished for that. 

Aaron
Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, I appreciate you. Listening, I appreciate even if you disagree with us, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to what we have to say and getting all the way to the end. And yeah, if you want to push back on what we said, especially in the the first half, like the violence, stuff like I really need you to just like. Never mind. Yeah, I don't. I just want to start relitigating it again at the last just. The beginning. You already know what I think. 

Shawn
One one thing is is is is please don't bring any criticism to us that applies equally or more so to your own position. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Aaron
That's one thing I wanted to say before, but like they just set up these scenarios where it's like, well, what are you going to do if they're like? Government is cracking down and like you don't have any weapons and they just come and run roughshod over like, well, what are you going to do if your little commune is surrounded by the American military and all you have is like 100 people with AR fifteens when they have tanks and that, like, I can make up situations where your position is obviously going to fail. Do the whole point of this is to avoid getting into those positions in the 1st place. Thank you for listen. Thank you for listening everyone.
