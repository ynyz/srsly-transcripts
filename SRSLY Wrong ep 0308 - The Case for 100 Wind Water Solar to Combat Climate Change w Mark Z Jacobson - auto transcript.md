Speaker 1
And she transits and Rangers our powers.

Aaron
I am solar power harnessing the power of the sun.

Speaker 3
I'm water power harnessing the power of hydroelectricity.

Aaron
I'm wind power using moving air to bring power to the people.

Speaker 3
Hey, guys. It's, it's me. I'm nuclear. Can I? Can I join you guys? I'm. I'm a futuristic energy source. I'm ready for large scale to shoot my pants.

Aaron
Nuclear. You're not part of the. Ohh, nuclear waste.

Speaker 3
One of you guys, hold on to this indefinitely for.

Aaron
Me. We're busy. We don't. I can't hold on to your waist indefinitely. Can you just shut it off, please?

Speaker 3
Oh. Hey **** again.

Aaron
Oh no, there's more. You're radiating us with that horrible, stinky nuclear.

Speaker 3
I just don't think we need you on the.

Aaron
Team man, I think we should banish nuclear.

Speaker 3
No, don't banish me. Pooping again and keep on pooping, guys.

Aaron
No, Sir. We gotta banish.

Speaker 3
You guys hold on to this indefinitely.

Speaker 1
For your energy, we banish you.

Aaron
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not like, I'm not like a dogmatist or whatever. It just doesn't just seems like we don't need him on the team. And if we couldn't do it on our own and we had, like, a really good way to deal with the waste and stuff and.

Speaker
Yeah.

Shawn
Yeah. If the technology was better or something, there's some sort of breakthrough or something.

Aaron
Like I'm not. Yeah. If it you know like it could be, but it just seems like we definitely don't need them. And like, yeah, stinky, stinky, stinky and harmful.

Shawn
Thank you.

Speaker 1
And the transmission room. No stinky nuclear.

Speaker 5
Are you sick and tired and mobilized by tears? Let me hope it here 1 towards the future. Imagine you told me that. Working together to protect our nation, destroy the states capital, its occupations future. Imagine you.

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome back to the Seriously Wrong podcast. It's the only podcast in the entire universe. It's gonna have 1000 episodes and lead to 10,000 years of World Peace. When we put that last piece, that last episode, episode 1000 at the top of the sort of like almost like the Christmas tree of episodes or something. Or like. House of Cards. That's what I'm thinking of. So one that won't fall, one that will stay. Yeah. Yeah. But like, one that stays up forever. You only think of metaphors or like dominoes.

Aaron
Like a Jenga tower? As the House of Cards and Jenga Towers, Tennessee. Yeah.

Shawn
Or like in the cat in the hat when he's balancing all the stuff. On. His feet and stuff, except one that was.

Aaron
Right. Maybe it could be built out of Lego. That's Lego stays.

Shawn
Strong leg. Yeah. Strong glue on it and. Stuff.

Aaron
Or you just leave it for a long time and the pieces will kind of get stuck.

Shawn
Together with age right, it settles into place.

Aaron
Yeah, it just kind of or like expands a little bit or it starts to melt into itself, I don't know. That's what I imagine. Anyway, that's what our show.

Shawn
Is like and on that beautiful one thousandth episode, Bing 10,000 years of World Peace around the world, Bing. And that's our guarantee. And that's all thanks to our generous patrons.

Thanks again if you're already doing that from the bottom of our heart, it makes all the difference in the world link in the description.

Aaron
So welcome to the show everybody. We are your hosts. I am Aaron and that's Sean. And we have a wonderful interview for you today with Mark Z Jacobson, who's going to be laying out a transition plan away from using combustible fossil fuels to 100% renewables. Why it's important to do that. How we do it, how it's possible. And yeah, it's a great.

Shawn
Interview and really excited to share that with you, but because it is the year of anger on seriously wrong at least sort of some of the time, the year of anger you. Know.

Speaker 5
Girl.

Shawn
I'm angry. That's our slogan this year. I thought we should. We should just talk a little bit about why the climate crisis makes us angry, because I don't know, like in day-to-day life, you don't always tap into that of, like, what makes you angry about the climate crisis? But if you think about it, there's some, like, really good reasons to be.

Aaron
Angry. Yeah, I mean natural disasters. And major climate events are like a constant thing that, yeah, I when I think about, like, what makes me angry, people dying and the environment going to **** is like top of the. This. The idea of, like the real human and environmental costs of this stuff, droughts, wildfires, climate events, floods.

Shawn
Yeah. I mean, there's like kids who are growing up without their parents because of, like landslides or flooding or towns being burned down. It, like, happened in Litton here in DC a couple of years back. And like, that's not just this passive sad thing that happens out in the world. It's like the result of policy decisions made by the oil and gas industry over the last 70 years. Tons of documents have come out over the last 10 years showing that deep degree that the oil and gas industry knew about the impact. Of combustible fuels on the climate. And there's a document from. Shell Oil. There's an internal document from like 1998, where they refer to in the future, people finding out that they knew all along and class action lawsuits coming in the 20 tens as a result of them knowing about the impacts of climate change. So like not only do they know all along, but they knew that we were going to figure out that they. Knew all along all along.

Speaker 6
Right.

Shawn
And then also the oil and gas industry corrupts our politics. So like is an insane return on investment that they get for every dollar of lobbying that they spend. They get, like, tons of money in subsidies and **** like that. Politicians are captured by the oil and gas industry. Environmental legislation is shaped by oil and gas companies to increase their profits. So all these impacts on people's lives that we're talking about. For the result of policy decision. Made by a corrupt out of control industry that is like living like kings by distorting our politics and intentionally there's also like they participated in spreading disinformation. It's like the tobacco industry thing too, like the tobacco industry found out it was causing cancer. And so they spent tons of money to try to convince people that it wasn't causing cancer or that it wasn't. Clear whether it was causing cancer so they could make more money for as long as possible, and the oil industry did that about the burning of fossil fuels.

Aaron
Yeah, I mean like, I guess it's one thing if you're accidentally destroying the environment like ohh whoops. Like we didn't know, like we genuinely thought we were doing a good thing here. Just getting power to the people we wanted to get fuel into tanks and, you know, move society forward. But then yeah, seeing documents where they're saying like. So yeah, all our scientists are telling us that this is going to really mess up the environment. You know, people are going to die from this, and they're going to blame us for it because we know about it and we know we know about it. Our documents say we know about it, but there is still a lot of profit to be made between then and now. It's probably not going to, you know, really start affecting people. For a few decades, so maybe we should just keep going. Yeah, it was pretty. It's pretty enraging.

Shawn
It's like there's been a series of choices made over the decades where, like, they looked at an innocent child's face and then they looked at piles of money. And they're like, yeah, kill him.

Speaker
Yes.

Shawn
That is the emotional story of the oil and gas industries relation to climate science is like they made that decision repeatedly over and over again. And these are people who have private jets, they have yachts, they have mansions, they're richer than your wildest dreams.

Aaron
They're building bunkers so that their kids aren't the ones that die. Maybe their kids. Kids will be because the bunkers are all run out of material or whatever. Sure. But you know, they're not thinking that far ahead. It's really like, gross the selfishness of that.

Shawn
Yeah, it's not even just like, making money at the expense of harming people. It's also like because of the efforts to spread misinformation to protect their profits, they are like driving social wedges and communities. Like every time you've been at a Thanksgiving dinner. And argued with your uncle about climate change or whatever like that. It's their fault that he's that misled and he's that age. Massive there's an alternate universe where they did the right thing where our relationships with those people who are on the other side of this divide is repaired as compared to now. So they put space in communities and like there's layers to how twisted this **** is, it's causing death. It's making money by destroying and torturing the planet. They're lying about it. And they're also just harming social relationships by having people in the world who are badly misled about what's happening. And it makes it so we can't collaborate towards solutions as a result of their work. So. It really is enraging.

Speaker
Yes.

Aaron
Yeah. It's kind of like tricking people into doing your, like, dirty work for you. I mean, just thinking about the divisions within families and communities and whatever, like, turning all these people into their little PR engines out there in the public, like defending the oil and gas industries on or of like, no, they really, they're trying to do the right thing.

Speaker
And.

Aaron
Climate change isn't even real.

Shawn
Yeah. So we'll, we'll return to this theme later in the episode around climate anger and our thoughts on this. Some of this stuff, but maybe you'll be good. We can start getting into our interview with Mark Jacobson, which is a lot more hopeful. It's focused on some of the things that we can do to fix some of these issues in the technological and social sphere. But yeah, without further ado, let's have a dose of hope with Marc Jacobson as he explains to us. Now, an alternative energy system is possible, desirable and within our grasp with existing technology. To roll the clip.

Aaron
Do I want to roll?

Shawn
The clip? Yeah. I mean, it's it's next to you.

Aaron
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

Shawn
You roll it over to me and I'll press play.

Aaron
Well, no, I'll do it. I'll do.

Shawn
It OK. Don't roll the clip. Just play it. I just. I'm gonna try to put you on the spot.

Speaker
Hello.

Shawn
Man, it's just you.

Aaron
Gotta do, yeah.

Shawn
Someone's gotta roll it. And if you don't want to, I'm.

Aaron
Happy to. No, I'm happy to do it. I just. I just, I don't know. It's something I don't know what that just happened. That was a little weird of you, I thought. But I don't know of you to be weird like.

Speaker 5
Did.

Aaron
That.

Shawn
But I thought I was being normal, but maybe I'm just. I think I just got excited about you rolling it and I I don't. Yeah, I don't. Not trying to make it weird. I'm sorry, I honor you. I I honor you.

Aaron
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I honor you, too. Yeah, we'll just. I'll play the.

Shawn
Play play. Let's play that clip. Smooth sailing. We'll play the clip. So yeah, I I really enjoyed reading your book. Thanks for joining us.

Mark
Yeah. Thanks for having me on.

Shawn
The book is no miracles needed. How today's technology can save our climate and clean our air. So I wanted to ask you, what's wrong with our current energy system and how does transitioning to a wind, water and solar energy system help fix those problems?

Mark
Well, our current energy system is dominated by combustion combustion of fossil fuels and bioenergy, and that results in both air pollution emissions of air pollutants that affect people's health. And greenhouse gases and particles that affect climate as well. And fossil fuels are limited resources, and that affects energy and security over the long term. Air pollution causes seven and a half million deaths per year worldwide and causes over a billion even up to 2 billion illnesses every year worldwide. So this is a problem that's dear to my heart that I want to solve or help solve, as is global warming, this last year, 2023 was the warmest record. Ever recorded by humans. There was about 1/2 a degree Celsius above the temperature the previous year, and so the temperature last year was about one almost 1.5°C above the 1850 to 1900 baseline period. And there was a half a degree above the previous year alone. It's just the temperatures have skyrocketed and global warming. Is becoming worse and worse at a faster and faster pace. And this is the problem. Because of so many problems associated with higher temperatures on average worldwide, including not only higher sea levels, which would lead to coastal flooding, melting ice, but heat stroke, heat stress that caused death and illness to hundreds of thousands of people to even millions of people worldwide. Loss of crops, salmon, drought, floods. More extreme weather, more extreme hurricanes. Higher air pollution, ocean acidification and climate migration, which has even led to civil war in some cases. So these are two serious problems. Air pollution and global warming that are due to the burning of fuels and energy insecurity is the third problem, which is not only the fact that fossil fuels. Unlimited resources. They will run out at some point, resulting in instability, social instability, economic instability, political instability. But also we're importing a lot of energy, a lot of countries import a lot of energy from other countries and so that means there can be supply disruptions. That's an energy and security problem. There's also the fact that you know you have to transport fuels in some cases over long distances to islands in the middle of the ocean, and that results in higher costs. So we want a solution that not only eliminates air pollutants and global warming pollutants, but also it eliminates or reduces significantly energy and security. If an island can produce. All its own energy. It doesn't need to transport that energy. You can reduce costs quite a bit if we don't have to rely on countries supplying fossil fuels across country borders over long distance, then that can reduce the reasons for some wars and instability. If we have fewer large scale power plants and more distributed energy, more just solar on rooftops for example, and wind turbines that are spread apart, there's less risk that the whole power grid that a large city will go down in terms of its power availability when there is a problem with, let's say, a large coal-fired power plant. Also, if we have energy sources that are renewable like wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric power. Then we reduce or eliminate that energy and security problem of using limited resources. So the solution here is in my mind and we've been working on plans since 2009 to transition the world to 100% clean renewable energy and storage, namely wind, water and solar. So we define that as not only generation of energy. Well, first of all, we would electrify all energy. That means think of all energies in four major sectors. There's electricity, transportation, buildings and industry. So for transportation, we would electrify that by going to battery electric vehicles for passenger vehicles and light duty vehicles, and even some large vehicles, including some short distance aircraft, short distance ships. And then we go to hydrogen fuel cell for long distance aircraft, long distance ships and some long distance. Large, heavy transport. And then in industry, there's a lot of energy used right now to burn coal and gas and oil and bio energy to produce high temperatures. So instead we would use existing technologies that run on electricity called electric arc furnaces, induction furnaces, resistance furnaces, dielectric heaters, electron beam heaters. And even electric. Heat pumps and for buildings. Most energy right now, a lot of energy is used in the form of gas, natural gas for heating, air heating, water cooking and even clothes drying in some cases. So we replace that with electric heat pumps for air heating. Water heating. Also heat pumps are used for air conditioning. We use electric induction, cook tops for cooking and even electric heat pump dryers. We go to LED lights, more energy efficiency in buildings. So we'd electrify all energy, and then we provide the electricity with just wind, water and solar. So that's onshore and offshore wind, solar photovoltaics on rooftops and or power plants, concentrated solar power, geothermal electricity, hydroelectricity and maybe small amounts of tidal and wave electricity. And then there would be some solar heat and geothermal heat. There be direct heating. Now we would need storage for such a system. We need electricity storage, heat storage, cold storage and some hydrogen storage. Where hydrogen would be used not only for long distance vehicles but also for steel production and ammonia production. So right now ammonia is made with hydrogen, but we would use hydrogen. That is what we call green hydrogen to produce ammonia. It's green hydrogen when it's produced from clean, renewable wind, water, solar electricity. So there are many types of electricity. Or options already available. Hydroelectric dams are the biggest source of electricity storage today. Then there's pumped hydro storage, where you have two reservoirs, a lower one and an upper one. When you have extra electricity, you pump water up a hill when you need that electricity, you let water drain down a hill and run through a generator to generate electricity. Then there's batteries. There's also concentrated solar power is associated with storage, and then there are other types of storage that are upcoming, like Fly wheels. There's compressed air storage, gravitational storage with solid masses. These are all existing technologies for heat storage, we would use water tanks mostly. Like we do today. But also there's underground seasonal heat storage and soil and water pits and aquifers. And there's cold storage in water tanks and in ice. So you know this whole system, we would eliminate air pollution. We would eliminate global warming emissions. And we provide energy security and there are many benefits, really just briefly, electrification and providing electricity with wind, water and solar would reduce worldwide power demand by about 56% for five reasons. The efficiency of electric heat pumps over combustion heating, the efficiency of electric vehicles. Over internal combustion engine vehicles. The efficiency of electrified industry over combustion industry, eliminating all the energy needed to mine, transport and refined fossil fuels in the uranium that's about 11% of all energy worldwide. We'd eliminate that energy need and then end use energy efficiency improvements beyond a business as usual case. That all adds up to about 56% reduction of demand. Without changing. Habits. That means even if the cost per unit energy were the same in the two systems, annual costs that people pay would be about 56% lower. However, wind, water, solar is now cheaper than fossil fuels per unit energy. So we estimate that the overall annual energy costs are about 63% lower. With just wind, water, solar. And the energy plus health plus climate costs are about 90 to 92% lower with wind water, so. Then we create more jobs, use less land. It's really not much we can complain about this new system.

Shawn
That's incredible because I mean, one of the big issues from my understanding and transitioning from fossil fuels to these electric energy. Systems is. You look at the graph of where all of our energy is coming from right now, and so much of his fossil fuels, and the question is, how could we ever replace that at the current rate? So it's more than twice as efficient because of all these little savings adding up in different places is what you're saying. When we switch to an electric system, we actually have to use less than half the total amount of energy we currently do.

Speaker
Wow.

Mark
I mean, think about it this way. Let's say right now we're using 100 units of energy for all purposes. About 20% of that or 20 units, is for electricity, and the rest is for transportation, fuels, industry, etcetera. If we go to a wind, water, solar electric system, our total energy demand goes down from 100 units to 44 units, but almost all those 44 units are now electricity. So our electricity demand double s. More little more than double s from 20 units to 44 units. But our overall energy demand goes down from 100 units to 44 units, served by 56% more electricity, less overall energy.

Shawn
Yeah, that's incredible. One of the big political issues that I've faced in talking about this, I've had a bunch of conversations about a wind, water, solar plan with people, and I find that sometimes people are just like, Nah, that's not possible. And I'm like, oh, there's this whole thing you can read. There's this big report. You can at the very least, some people think this is possible. So I'm curious what convinced you that this is possible? How did you come to this conclusion that when water, solar and renewable energy is an answer to these problems, you know, I assume that a lot of people are going to agree this is desirable, but they've got some lingering cynicism or doubts, or a sense of hopelessness about this stuff.

Mark
Well, our first plan was in 2009 and it was a world plan that did not look at individual countries. It was looking at worldwide numbers. Now do we have enough renewable energy resources in terms of solars or enough solars or enough wind, is there enough hydro, geothermal? So the first finding was, yeah, there's enough solar to power the whole world over 3000 times over for all purposes, for example, now, not necessarily in places that are close by, but we don't need that much. We need 1/3 thousandth of the total available. You know, there's enough wind to power the whole world about eight times over. Now hydro is not going to grow much more than. Currently in geothermal won't grow a huge amount, but there is a lot of geothermal deep down, but it's pretty expensive to get there. So it's mostly going to be wind and solar and then you know, the other question is, well, OK, if we did want to power would would just rent and sell or how much land would that take and you know, certainly there's offshore wind, which doesn't take up new land. There's rooftop solar, which doesn't. Take. Up new land, but when you look at the amount of land that we would need if we just did power with wind and solar. It's not a huge amount of land, especially when we look at it more detail like we've done worldwide in individual countries like in the United States right now, the fossil fuel industry occupies about 1.3% of all United States land area. And you know, there are 50,000 new oil and gas wells drilled every year. There are 1.3 million active ones and 3.2 million.

Speaker 3
No.

Mark
Abandoned oil and gas wells in the United States alone, so if we transition our wind, water, solar, we'd be using actually about 1% or less of the land. So we'd actually reduce land requirements and we wouldn't be building 50,000 new oil and gas wells every year. So we would eliminate that growth because once you have a wind, water, solar system up. You don't need to dig for fuel anymore, right? And so the the fuel is coming too. The wind turbines, the solar panels directly. So you don't need to dig for fuel. So you don't have that land requirement. You don't have that cost either. Wind is free, solar is free. That's why the whole thing is going to be much cheaper. That's because we're using free fuels. Yeah, you do need some growth over time because population grows, but that's much less growth. Land use then when you have to dig for fuels every day for. Eternity. It's just not sustainable. So in 2009 we developed this plan for the world. Said, yeah, it's feasible to do from a not only from a resource point of view a land point of view, but also look at costs from a cost point of view. And we have done a little bit of studies on reliability, not obviously not in detail, but the conclusion was yeah, it's technically and economically. Possible to transition the world to 100% wind, water, solar for all purposes and even by 20-30. It's technically and economically possible, but for social political reasons that probably wouldn't happen till maybe 2050. So a good goal would be like 80% by 20 thirty 100% by 20. 50 but we did say it's it is possible by 20-30 and that turned out to be this paper, which was published in Scientific America in 2009, turned out to be the scientific basis for what's called the Green New Deal, which is a policy proposal initiated in the United States to transition the country to 100% renewable energy by 20-30 now this. I know you know, people thought, oh, just pie in the sky. This is just theoretical. This will never work, you know, a worldwide plan is, you know, nobody's controlling the whole world. Nobody can implement policy on a worldwide scale. So we had to look at, you know, find a resolution. So we started a plan for the whole United States in 2011. That we found that the same result, but then we looked at individual states. We started with New York, then we went to California. Did Washington state, then we did all 50 United States and we found, yeah, we can transition all 50 United States to wind, water, solar. And that actually took off from policies perspective, these state plans. Were implemented quite a bit in the United States. In the 2016 election, for example, for president, all three Democratic candidates actually adopted our 100% renewables plan as part of their platform, and the whole Democratic platform adopted 100% renewables. Ultimately, as of now, 18 States and Puerto Rico and Washington DC have adopted 100% renewable. Laws in the electric power sector are effectively 100% renewables, so this and these laws and and they're some of them are executive orders were originated from our energy plan. So that was a great poll. They win to actually have science based plans that implemented into policy and then as I mentioned, they were the science bases of the Green New Deal, which is a federal proposal that never got voted on. But there have been eight laws and resolutions introduced into the United States Congress. House and Senate are calling for 100% renewables based on these plans, but none has ever been. Talked about meantime in 2017. We then developed plans at first for 139 countries.

Speaker
Of the world.

Mark
And that got expanded to 143 countries in 2019 and 145 countries in 2022. And now 149 countries this year, 2024. And these plans are very specific for individual countries. We find the same thing. We can transition every individual country we've checked and we're limited by those countries because those are the countries for which the international. Energy Agency has data available for all the energy sectors and fuel types that we can actually and. But we found we can do it everywhere. We can transition everywhere. And now 63 or 62 or 63 countries have policies or laws to transition to 100% renewables in the electric power sector. Only Denmark has policies to go to 100% in all energy sectors, policies have been one, you know, measure of the usefulness of these plans. But even more important there actually now, if we look at data, there are actually many countries and U.S. states that have gone a long way toward transitioning toward 100% renewables. There are now like five countries in the world that are at 100% wind, water, solar and their electricity generation. In the annual average and like Albania, that's mostly All in all these countries are dominated by hydro. Iceland is one that is mostly hydro, but else has low geothermal and wind and Norway is pretty close. They have lot of hydro too and wind, there's Paraguay, there's Uruguay and there are ten countries that are 97.5% to 100% wind water. Or. Bhutan, Nepal, even Tajikistan is way up there, getting dominated by hydropower, and there are 45 countries that are 50% to 100% wind, water, solar and their electric power generation in the United States, there are 11 states that generate between 50 and 100% of the. Electricity that they consume effectively from wind, water, solar, starting with South Dakota is around 96%. Iowa is close to, you know, 90. Percent and those are dominated by wind. In fact, there are seven states that generate 50 to 80 or 90% of the electricity that they consume from just wind alone. And these states, by the way, the electricity cost in those states is below the US average. So here's an example where high penetrations of wind, water. Solar in this case particularly went have shown that that keeps the cost of electricity. Yeah, you know, some people complain about renewables. Oh, it's just going to drive the prices up. But that statement is belied by the fact that there are seven states that generate 50 to 90% of the electricity just from wind alone. The electricity that they consume from window loan that have lower than average US electricity prices. So in reality, wind, water, solar is being implemented, but we have a long way to go worldwide. We're only like 10% of the way there compared to you know for all energy sectors to transition. So we still have to solve 90% of the problem. But China, for example, is the biggest country in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. But it has actually installed huge amounts of wind and solar, and even hydropower in the last few years. And it's it is doing a lot to go further. And so even this coming year, there'll be more huge installations. Coming in China, along with many other countries. In the world.

Shawn
We're at war. War with the oil profiteers and planet tortures, war with the PR firms and professional liars who cut open our communities to bleed us out for profit. We're at war with the combustion fuels that give kids asthma, greenwashing executives who spend more on green oil advertising than low carbon projects. We're at war with the politicians who take money from oil and gas for their campaigns. And repay them generously with subsidies and handouts from the public purse. We're at war with the people who live like kings while they burn the planet and poison our children for profit. My name is Felix Bones. You're a spooky conductor, and this is narrative wars because there's a war on for your story. Alright folks, here at the top of the hour, we're going over the evidence that the oil and gas industry knew what they were doing as early as 70 years ago. Today we have the documents, but first up, a word from our sponsor. This episode of Felix Jones narrative Words is brought to you by crank. In wisdom, supplements get cranked up and have the brain of a crank to focus on crank leg details of public policy with our patented mixture of organic and all natural brain compounds that make you obsessive and detail oriented about the things that really matter, like climate change, public transit, poverty, and corruption. Now it won't grow your amount of Twitter. Followers, but it will grow the clarity that you have in your mind. I've been taking crank brain wisdom pills every day this year and my ability to 0 in on seemingly niche details to obsessively build a personalized and esoteric understanding has gone through the roof. I've been writing almost daily letters to my congressman, my mayor, and the president. Talking 8-9 page letters with extensive citations personalized to their office every day this year. That's crank brain wisdom supplements. In a nutshell, use the promo code get cranked to get 10% off your order in the narrative war store. All right, folks. So we're talking about the ways in which the fossil fuel industry knew about climate change early and worked to mislead the public to protect their profits. It is anger here on narrative wars, and it's time to get angry about what they're doing to our world and our children for money to enrich themselves at our expense. In July of 1977, a top climate scientist at Exxon internally informed the company there is a general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels. He followed up in 1978 a doubling of CO2 gases in the atmosphere. Would increase the global temperatures by another two or three degrees, a number that is consistent with the scientific consensus today. The oil and gas industry was aware of this. Information was also aware that it could affect their profitability, so they pursued a strategy of obfuscation, denial and increasing fear, uncertainty and doubt in the public sphere, spending millions of dollars to create false narratives in public perceptions about climate change, to slow the fight against climate change. So they can make more money by bleeding out our children coming into our homes and dragging them kicking and screaming into the street. In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen told the US Congress that the planet was already warming and despite being warned internally by their scientists for. Decades Exxon at the time claimed the science was still uncertain. They spent billions of dollars trying to muddy the waters of public opinion, and 1998 memo written by the American Petroleum Institute, an association of oil companies including BP, Exxon Mobil and Shell, titled Global Climate Science Communications Plan, contained a quote about the strategy. Victory will be achieved. On the average, citizens and the media are convinced of uncertainties in climate. That science now it's not that they believed there was uncertainties, it's that they knew there were not uncertainties and that there was money to be made by lying to the people, dividing their communities and dragging families kicking and screaming into the street for profit. It even came out earlier this year. It goes back further than the 1970s. In the mid 1950s and. Air Pollution Research Group, funded by the oil industry and car manufacturers, funded a study into CO2 and climate. Change that found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels will have planetary impacts marking the earliest known time at present that the fossil fuel industry was unambiguously told about the potentially deeply damaging impacts of fossil fuel combustion. That is, 70 years ago, more than twice my lifetime as Felix Bones, they have known this. And they have worked to mislead the public. A 1988 internal memo from Shell on the Greenhouse Effect revealed that Shell started funding internal research into the greenhouse effect of oil as early as 1981. And in 1998, internal memo predicted that class action lawsuits would start in the. 20 tens based on the oil and gas industry. Knowing about this stuff and working to hide it in 2021, a senior Exxon lobbyist was caught on tape confessing to the strategy. Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes, said Keith McCoy. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts to fight climate change? Yes, that is true, but there is nothing illegal about that, he said. You know, we were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders. Talk about saying the quiet part out loud. Of course, Exxon Mobil chief executive Darren Woods lied through his teeth about the incident, saying we were shocked by these interviews and stand by our commitments to work on finding solutions to climate change. Yes, we all believe you, Darren, you are so convincing to us and you seem like such a good guy. Why don't you come to Felix Bones's barbecue? Darren's chief executive of ExxonMobil, you're a climate change fighter, aren't you? Ohh, you're basically a a ******* activist, aren't you? You were shocked by that. You found it shocking when he confessed to, but your strategy has been for 70 years. Yeah, that must have been real shocking for you, Darren. Do they keep you in a box? Darren? Do they bury you underground so you can't hear or see anything that happens in your company? Darren. Darren, you don't know that a 2019 report on top oil and gas companies found that they were spending $200 million a year on PR for social media. Greenwashing their efforts while still spending 97% of their operating budget on high carbon projects in a climate crisis? That's news to you, Darren, are you shocked to hear that? Darren, you're gonna come out-of-the-box and help us join Greta in the streets? Go **** yourself, Darren Wood. Next up, we've got a very special guest. His name is Jimmy Jam Jam and he is an expert in the ways that the oil and gas industry corrupts our politics. And I'll just turn over the camera pan. He's been sitting here for a little while listening to me. Sorry, you've got a little bit of my spit on your face. Here's a napkin to wipe it off. It's and the napkins, the narrative wars. Napkins are available in the store if you use the coupon code. Spittle. You can get 10% off. It's the only napkins that will protect you from the Illuminati brain rays.

Aaron
And it's a absorbent napkin. It's a nice thick plush napkin face soft against your skin. I wouldn't.

Shawn
100% organic as well.

Aaron
I wouldn't clean spittle off with anything else. Thank you so much. It's always a pleasure. It's always an honor. And may I just say that crank brain wisdom pills. I've been taking them too. And the focus, it's like nothing. It's it's. I've quadrupled my work output.

Speaker
Well.

Shawn
A planner.

Speaker 1
That's it.

Shawn
It's a planner to take them, which is a pleasure, honor, and it's a planner to have you here.

Aaron
Well, it's a planner to hear you say that. So thinking about how the oil and gas industry corrupts our politics is really an enraging topic. I think you'll be enraged by what I have to say. And I think your audience will be. Enraged by. It as well. Well, good. Did you know that between 1995 and 2005, the oil and gas industry spent $2.9 billion on advocacy? And advertising to mislead the public on climate change. And $1.3 billion to shape public policy.

Shawn
That's more money than I've ever seen. In.

Aaron
My life it's a lot of money. It boggles the mind. I like thinking about that, thinking about like 4 1/2 billion dollars spent in those ten years, and it's only gotten worse since then. According to Oil Change International, for every dollar the oil and gas industry. Spends on lobbying politicians in America. They see $59 back in direct subsidies, but that stat is actually from 2009 to 2010, so. When I was looking at this with my crank brain wisdom pills in there, I wanted to see what the current numbers were like. So I looked it up in 2022. They spent $124 million on lobbying in the United States. And in return got $18.4 billion in direct federal spending going to the industry, which is actually a return of $148 for every dollar spent. Or another way of putting that is 14,800% return on investment for those dollars spent in lobbying.

Shawn
That's called rent seeking. It's where an industry will donate to politicians. And in exchange, they get favorable treatment and regulations, handouts, subsidies and so on. So if you spend $100 helping politicians get elected, you're repaid by a policy that puts money from the public purse into your coffers as private industry.

Aaron
Yeah. And I want to emphasize though, these numbers I've been talking about are direct federal spending. Given to the oil and gas industry, those numbers, that percentage actually increases drastically when you include preferential oil and gas lease royalty rates, specialty tax preferences, research and development. Loan guarantees tax incentives, that kind of thing. When you do that, the oil and gas industry in 2023 actually received not 18.4 billion in federal spending, but about $757 billion in various incentive subsidies, etcetera. All those things I listed. So if you think about it in terms of all the return on investment they're getting, it's actually closer to $6000 for every dollar spent on lobbying.

Shawn
Wow, what a beneficial arrangement for the demons who are poisoning and destroying. Our world. Imagine if you donated $10 to your local politician and then after they were elected, they gave you $60,000 in benefit.

Aaron
I would love that, honestly.

Shawn
I would love that too. That would make me so rich so fast.

Aaron
But that's it. That's a deal that doesn't get given to the little guys like us. Feel like that's a deal reserved only for oil and gas industry or other major billionaires and people like.

Shawn
That, and if your little guy go to the narrative war store to get big boy bulking pills. Now these are the patented formula that will increase your body size by up to five to 10%. Add it to your stack to grow up. Now we are the little guys. We are not the big oil and gas industry, but there's no reason we can't grow with supplements from the narrative war store. Use the coupon code, little baby narrative boy to get 10% off.

Aaron
The Canadian Center for Policy. Alternatives found that between 2011 and 2018, records showed that the oil and gas lobby met with Canadian politicians 11,452 times to advocate for their policies and priorities, which is. The most lobbying of any sector during the period, totaling about 6 contacts per day. So if you think about, you know what your politicians are spending their time on, what they're doing, I just know that, you know, 11. 452 * 452 meetings in those seven years. That's a lot. A lot of influence, a lot of meetings, a lot of time spent given to these.

Shawn
People I remember this document in the years between 2000 and 2018, oil production increased in Canada by 80%, while taxes on oil producers went down by half. And royalties down by 63%. That lobbying really paid off.

Aaron
The report concluded that there is an elite policy network that extends between both right wing and center left governments between elections, where long term relationships are built between state power and corporate power, influencing policy without democratic oversight.

Shawn
Well, that's what we've been saying on the show for a long time. I'm so glad that mainstream media is.

Aaron
Finally, yeah, yeah, we've you've had the documents for years and you've been saying.

Shawn
Coming around on.

Aaron
Three years. But I think another aspect of this that sometimes gets under discussed is that you know all these things we've been talking about are technically legal. Lobbying is legal, subsidies are legal, having tons of meetings with oil and gas industry professionals from politicians, it's all legal. But the oil and gas industry we do know are also doing illegal things behind the curtain. The panel peanut bribery. Handle it started with a complaint filed with the SEC alleging that between 2002 and 2007, Panalpina incorporated bribed government officials in. Multiple countries. Bribes totaling at least $49 million. The countries in Angola, Brazil, Russia, Nigeria, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Panalpina is a shipping company. Who did these bribes on behalf of CUSS? Numbers. Their major customers include at least six major oil companies and their subsidiaries like Royal Dutch Shell, Incorporated, Pride International, Tide Water, Transocean Global, Santa Fe, Etcetera. The purpose of these bribes were to circumvent local rules and import regulations to gain. Preferential treatment to expedite the importation of goods and equipment, obtain lower tax, etc. Limits and also allowed them to extend drilling contract and obtain false paperwork related to offshore drilling rigs. And that's just the bribery that we know about. I would assume that there is probably 1,000,000 billions, maybe perhaps more of bribery that's been going on at the same time and ever since that this is 1 little window. They caught because they got caught and they had to admit it, and they had to pay some fines to get that back. Not enough fines. But this is how these people operate. They do what they want with impunity, destroying the planet for.

Shawn
Your own benefit, and this all has real effects on the people folk. You know, we're having major climate events. 2023 was the hottest year on record. We've had record hot months, month after month for something like 14 or 15 months. Now we have wildfires, floods, landslides, storms and hurricanes taking people's lives and livelihoods away from them. Droughts which threaten access to drinking water. And stable access to food, all for the profits of small group of oil and gas companies who do not care about us. They would sooner see us die than sacrifice. Even a small amount if they're profit. And they have the gall to look us in the eye, smile and say we're working on green energy. We're going to lead the climate transition. That doesn't make you angry, folks. I don't know what will. As we were working on this episode, Shell announced on March 14th, 2024, that they're gonna be backtracking on an earlier pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035. Citing uncertainty in the transition to renewables, so all of that ink was wasted on all those press releases about what good guys they are and how much they deserve to be patted on the back because they just rolled it right on back while we weren't paying attention right under our nose. This has been Felix Bones narrative wars because there's a war on for your story and get angry folks once you know what to do, the next step is to get angry. I'll talk to you next time. Thanks to our.

Aaron
Guest. Thank you, Felix.

Shawn
And may mother Gaia rise up and pull down the captains of industry into the earth. Talk to you next time. A lot of the time when I've talked about this in public and talked with people with the most consistent thing and I don't know if it's an Internet thing. It seems to be a recent thing. Over the last couple of years that you see more and more of it is that there's some very strong nuclear advocates in your book. You've got a chapter on nuclear and what you think the limits of nuclear are. Can you sort of compare and contrast? Nuclear versus the wind, water, solar, plant and and why you think the wind, water, solar is. Superior.

Mark
Yeah, they're basically 7 reasons why nuclear going forward is not helpful. And two are kind of practical and economic and their rest are energy security problems. Even if energy security is not an issue, it's just the delay, the time it takes for a new reactor. Well, let me break this up. You have conventional reactors, which are large ones. The new conventional reactors and their existing ones. And then there are what we call small modular nuclear reactors that are being proposed going forward. As well. So in terms of like new large conventional reactors and liberalized markets like in Europe and in the United States, for example, they're taking between 17 and 21 years between planning and operation in the United States, only two reactors have been installed in the last 20 years and both at the same location in Georgia. And they've taken 17 to 18 years each between planning and operation, and they cost $35 billion for a total between the two of them and about 2.3 gigawatts. So it's on the order of almost $16.00 a Watt. And that compares with $1.00 a Watt for new onshore wind or solar utility scale solar. And so it's 16 times the capital cost and the new wind or solar well rooftop solar can take like six months. You can put it on six months, but utility scale is like one to three years. We're talking on the order of 15 to 17 years longer. And the 16 times the capital cost. And even if you look at the levelized cost of energy, which is when you count for the not only the capital cost but the operation and maintenance cost, the fuel cost and the actual output of electricity, the cost of energy for nuclear, new nuclear is about 5 to 8 times that of new onshore wind or utility scale soil. So it cost much more and it takes much longer to implement. So due to the high air pollution death rates that are occurring today and the high temperatures we need to solve 80. Percent of the. Problem the climate and pollution problems we face by 20-30. So that's six years away and 100% by 2035 to 20. But so if you have a technology, that's when it starts today won't be ready till 2041, which is 17 years from now. That is not helpful at all for solving the climate crisis or the air pollution crisis or energy security crises we face. And so it's just not helpful and it's useless, in fact. OK, on top of that, you have these other energy security. Conditions one is that nuclear weapons proliferation about five countries in the world have developed nuclear weapons secretly under the guise of civilian nuclear energy or research reactor programs, and there are only around 30 or so countries that have nuclear energy. So one six of them have actually developed weapons secretly. And so if we want to spread. Nuclear energy to other countries. You know, there's a good chance that some of them will try to develop. Weapons. Then there's meltdown risk. There have been about 6 reactors that have seriously melted down, and there's some others that have melted down to lesser degrees. But six out of 400 reactors in the world is about 1.5% failure rate. So 1 1/2% of all reactors ever built have or have been running on its sustained scale, have melted down to some degree. Then there's waste. What do you do with the wait? You have to store for 200,000 to 300,000 years. And right now, like in the United States, the waste is stored on site at each reactor. And there's really not an answer to that. But it takes a lot of energy to maintain that waste also for that long period of time. And then there's underground uranium mining. Historically about 10% of underground uranium miners have died of lung cancer. Because uranium it's one of its decay products is radon. Radon is a gas. Then the radon will convert to polonium. Palladium gets into peoples systems and. And is a carcinogen and contributes to lung cancer. And then there's carbon emission. So people say, well, nuclear is carbon free, but it's not. Not only is there a lot of carbon, half the carbon is emitted by the fact that it takes so long to build a nuclear reactor and plan it compared with wind or solar. So if it's taking, let's say, two years to build a solar plant. And 17 years to build a nuclear reactor that's a 15 year difference. So during that 15 years, you're emitting a lot of carbon from coal plants and gas plants. That has to be a. Then there's all the carbon from the construction of the nuclear plant, like the vocal plants, there was enough cements putting these plants for a sidewalk between Miami and Seattle and all that carbon emissions was emitted before a single kWh of electricity was generated. So there's this backup of carbon emissions from the construction. There's all the carbon emissions from the delays. Then you also have to mine and refine uranium. And that's a very energy intensive process. There's target emissions there, then the actual power plants themselves, they emit heat and water vapor. The heat is just a radioactive decay product. Direct heat to the atmosphere and water vapor do because you need cooling water to cool the reactors. And that results in water evaporation and water. That's the greenhouse gas. So when you add up all these emissions, it's about 9 to 37 times the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as new wind, which is less than gas. But it's still not trivial. It's pretty actually pretty. So you have these additional problems in addition to the delays and the high costs. And so This is why we don't use large new nuclear reactors. We don't propose to use those same thing with small modular reactors. They have the same issues as the large ones. They may even be more expensive because initially before large reactors were built, we were trying to build small ones, but. We went to large ones due to economies of scale because it's cheaper to build bigger reactors, so now they're trying to go to smaller reactors. So there's more material per unit energy output required can result in higher. Costs and the delays seem to be the same. You know, they're initially proposals to have some new reactors available by 20-30, but even those have been delayed in like the company that's the furthest along, which is called new scale in small modular reactors. They actually had a design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, their largest. Purchaser bailed out because of high costs and high costs in general, have also resulted in them laying off half their workforce. And there's no clear path for them to actually develop a nuclear reactor that's even testable by 20-30 at this point, you know, and these other companies not as far along. So we don't. We have no idea how long it will take to actually develop a test reactor, let alone a commercial one. But we need 80% of the problem solved by 20-30. When they can't even guarantee, not even a test reactor by 20-30, it's just not worth spending time trying to own this. Going forward, we need to just deploy, deploy, deploy technologies that work right away at low cost and the costs of these new reactors, as I said are probably going to be the same or higher than the large. Doctors, they have many of the same energy security problems. Weapons proliferation is even worse because now you have small reactors that can be shipped around the world. More countries would have access to nuclear materials. Meltdown risk. We don't know. Some designs may have less, but others may have more meltdown risk. Some say that they there's less waste because they refine their uranium more. But in that case then it's more weapons. Proliferation risk because you have higher refined uranium, and anyway there's still going to be storage risk, waste storage that will have to be had for most of these designs and you still have these carbon emissions due to delays and obtaining uranium etcetera, etcetera. There's nothing to be said about these smaller reactors that gives me confidence that these are actually useful for anything whatsoever and existing reactors. I'd say as long as they don't have to be subsidized, we can keep them until they naturally retire. But subsidizing is not a good path forward existing reactors because. That subsidy money could be used to replace these reactors with clean, renewable energy, which are going to have to do in any case, so why waste additional subsidy money just to keep the reactors open when that subsidy money itself could be used to actually build new replacements right now?

Shawn
We now go to a public men's washroom.

Aaron
Gotta pee. Gotta pee. Gotta pee. Gotta urinal here.

Speaker
Get up to the.

Aaron
Oh Oh yeah.

Speaker
Oh.

Aaron
That's nice. Hey, partner. Ohh. Hey. Yeah, you know, there's lots of. There's lots of open ones down there. It's like.

Shawn
Oh, you don't want me to use the urinal? Right next to you.

Aaron
I mean, I guess you can, it's just you can't.

Shawn
I'm sorry I already got a flow going at move now.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
I'm not looking or anything, it's it's all good.

Aaron
No. Yeah, it's just not. What people normally do, but hey, you.

Shawn
Know what I thought of it as? Like filling up the urinal, you know, and the furthest one. And then, yeah, so I'm moving towards the. So then.

Aaron
You were intentionally right. Yeah, I just took the furthest one from the door thinking, you know someone else. It doesn't. Yeah, it. Doesn't.

Shawn
And I took the second for this one from the door because I was thinking like we'd sequentially fill up all.

Aaron
The urinals? Yes, there's a big.

Shawn
Rush. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it looks like we're in the clear, but the just in case it does, just where my mind? Hey, but did you know that fully converting human energy use to nuclear with single pass reactors is completely impossible?

Aaron
No, I thought nuclear wasn't that actually like one of the better ways to get us out of using fossil fuels. I thought that nuclear was, like, pretty.

Shawn
Nope. No, it turns out no. Yeah, I know. I just read this book. This Marc Jacobson book. No miracles needed, actually. Part of the reason I have to pee so bad and I'm peeing so long is because I was holding in the pee. As I finished reading this. After because I was so.

Aaron
Engrossed in it, right. Yeah, we've all been.

Shawn
There, but yeah, uranium reserves that were known about as of 2019 only have enough fuel to last our current single pass reactors around the world for 147 years. With the current capacity. So growing nuclear power would deplete those reserves faster. I mean, 147 isn't that many years and and you know the. Long run of human history, obviously.

Aaron
Right. And not a lot of our energy is currently coming from new. Like if we tried to transition to nuclear, we would be building tons of new plants would drastically decrease those remaining years, yeah.

Shawn
Yes. So if we wanted to. 100% nuclear energy for all of our energy needs. We'd need about 9 trillion watts, which would require about 12,500, eight 150 MW nuclear reactors, which is about 31 times the amount which are in existence today. So that means we'd have to make one nuclear plant per day every day for the next 34 years. And it takes decades. For a nuclear reactor to come online. But even if we could do that, let's just say that we could get it all done very quickly and set them all up today and we didn't have to, you know, one of the issues too is that when you're setting up the nuclear reactors, you need to use fossil fuels in the meantime. That's one of the reasons that wind, water and solar is good is a lot. Of its deployable in a much faster way, so we can start transitioning more energy away from combustion fuels. But even if we were able to close the gap on the 12,508 hundred 50 MW nuclear reactors, that would mean that all known uranium reserves would be depleted within three years. So it's just like as far as single pass reactors go, it is just totally impossible to convert to an. Entirely nuclear energy.

Aaron
Wow. No, that's that's fascinating. I didn't. Yeah. There we go and I'm done peeing. But yeah, that's that's. I didn't know that.

Shawn
I'm done peeing. Well, let's go wash our hands. I mean, you wash your hands.

Aaron
After you pee, right. Ohh. Of course. Yeah. Especially if someone else.

Shawn
Is in the bathroom with me. Do you mind if I wash my hands in the sink right next to you so I could share just a few more facts about nuclear power?

Aaron
Yeah, normally I would be like ohh, why are you going right next to me? If there's space. But yeah, these these facts have been blowing my mind, so keep them coming.

Shawn
So another issue and you know, Pro nuclear advocates will often downplay this because it's a very sort of quote, Al Gore, an inconvenient truth. Yes, not that I'm. I mean I have my issues with Gore, but he was right. On that, we. Can all say every country with nuclear capabilities increases nuclear weapons proliferation risk, which is really serious. You know, in the world there's 30 nuclear countries, six of them have engaged in secret weapons programs under the pretense of civilian energy infrastructure. So that's a really high percentage of. So if you put nuclear plants. All around the world and you keep that. Ratio, you're talking about a massive amount of nuclear weapons being created, tons of secret nuclear programs.

Aaron
Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah, there would be a big overlap. There's the perfect.

Shawn
Cover. Really. So, yeah. And if we want to be serious about evaluating the the climate impacts of nuclear energy, we have to factor in the ecological impacts of a potentially devastating nuclear bomb detonation. You know, first of all, 2 to 16 million people could be killed by a 15K. That's one bomb which is bad enough for human lives are obviously have value at, you know, one one life is valuable, let alone 16,000,000. But a bomb that's detonated could burn between 63 and 313 million tons of city infrastructure, adding 5 million tons of warming and cooling aerosols to the atmosphere and emitting between 92 and 690 million tons of carbon dioxide. So when we're calculating the carbon impacts of nuclear power, we have to consider that in the high end possibilities and estimates, the low ends for this would be that there'd be no nuclear bombs that go off and fingers crossed. That would be the case. But there's a very real possibility when you have 6 out of 30 nuclear countries having secret weapons program. That at some point in the future there would be a detonation of bombs, causing an enormous amount of carbon release and massive cost to human life.

Aaron
Oh yeah, you always think about how horrifying nuclear bombs are because of the death and destruction of infrastructure. I hadn't even thought about the climate impacts of, like, carbon being emitted because of a nuclear bomb attack. That's a. Oh, you've given me a lot to think about here. This has been a. More thoughtful trip to the bathroom than I typically have.

Shawn
Yeah, I mean, and let's see you killed 16 million people with a windmill.

Aaron
Now I'm just thinking about how to do that. It would be really hard. You'd have to spin it really fast and put like razor blades on it and like, put people on a conveyor belt so that the windmill chops their heads off.

Shawn
Yeah, I don't think you could do it. Something. That, yeah. The logistics it's much more challenging than a nuclear bomb, yeah.

Aaron
Yeah. No. Yeah, you would need more than just a windmill. You would need a whole system of.

Shawn
Yeah, windmill based death.

Aaron
Yeah, it would be. It's far fetched. Let me.

Shawn
Say so yeah. I mean, I think, you know, wind, water, solar power, it's possible and desirable and they've done detailed analysis. They've got plans on how it could be done around the world. So I think it's a.

Aaron
And I mean solar panels. I mean, you could smash someone over the head with a solar panel, but not that many. They're pretty weak, like it wouldn't.

Shawn
I guess you could. It's kind of you could use solar to make have like an array of mirrors that point a hyper hot array of like right solar energy at someone but.

Aaron
That's completely different than a panel that's.

Speaker
Right.

Shawn
Like. Yeah, and there's never. That's never been. You know, there's never been a a civilian historic. Sure. Yeah, exactly. It's our civilian infrastructure, solar power. And we've got our secrets.

Aaron
There's no infrastructural examples of that, yeah.

Shawn
Our death Ray program coming out of it, I thought it's impossible, but it just hasn't.

Speaker
Right.

Aaron
Yet happened. Yeah. Guess. Wind, water and.

Shawn
Solar. All right. Well, I'm realizing now that I actually have to go pee a second time.

Aaron
But it was nice to talk to you. Well, enjoy. Yeah. Someone else is coming in to use the urine. I'll. Maybe you can enlighten them as well.

Shawn
Hey have a good. One man, see. Ya, I'll just unzip again and let it flow. In addition to nuclear, I'm curious about solar radiation management. Something has come up on the show as the spraying the particulates in the atmosphere as a way of dealing with climate change and also carbon capture and storage is another really frequently touted solution. If you could speak briefly on those.

Mark
Yeah, well, first solar radiation management. So one of the proposals is let's spray particles in the stratosphere that are reflective of light to cool the surface, reduce the amount of sunlight getting to the surface. Now that is not a solution to anything. That is what we call masking the problem. It doesn't. First of all, it doesn't do anything for air pollution because we're not actually addressing any emissions. So we continue with seven and a half million people dying in a, you know, 1 to 2 billion people becoming ill from air pollution every year. In fact, that goes up because some of those particles that are going to the stratosphere come down to the toward the surface, and 90% of the air pollution. Are due to particles. But it also creates other risks and doesn't solve climate change it all it does is reduce sunlight to the surface, which is affects temperatures to some degree, but doesn't affect other aspects of climate change, including ocean acidification, where carbon dioxide that's still being emitted is dissolving in ocean water and then destroying coral reefs because of carbon dioxide. As an acid that goes to carbonic acid, that destroys coral reefs and other ocean life, but you now have less sunlight coming to the surface, that means less photosynthesis, so less crop growth. So now that can lead depending on the magnitudes that can lead to starvation. Other problems in some parts of the world that are already close to subsistence levels. Let's say you get, you know, 5% less solar radiation to the surface. That will result in less for sure. So that's the side effect. You know, the reason we have the ozone hole and the global stratospheric ozone. Reduction is because chemical reactions occur on the surface of the particles, and especially when the ozone hole appears. It's because we get these ice crystals. Forming over the. Southern Hemisphere near the South Pole region. It gets really cold and you get these ice crystals and on the surface of those ice crystals you have these chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine that have been emitted. Since the 19. If by solar radiation management you're putting in new particles that you don't even need to form a polar stratospheric clouds, you actually have particles there year round now because of human injection of these particles and on the surface of these particles you can get ozone destruction. So that's a big risk about what would actually happen to the ozone layer. And if we do that, then people have become complacent. We don't have to solve the climate problem, so we even admit more, so this is not a solution. This is a horrible suggestion by runaway scientists to mask the problem and allow fossil fuels to. So other technologies that allow fossil fuels to continue our carbon capture, direct air capture, blue hydrogen and electrofuels those technologies are all designed by the fossil fuel industry to keep themselves. Going. So what are they? So carbon capture and is when you put a device, let's say in a coal-fired power plant or some other source of carbon dioxide. The pollutants. And the device will remove some of the carbon dioxide from the exhaust stream of a, let's say, a coal-fired power plant. Now it's doesn't remove 100% on average worldwide of all the carbon capture facilities, the removal rate is between 10 and 80% in the annual average. So not really efficient tactic on half the plants less than 50% removal, but that's not the main problem. The main problem is well first. So there's an energy penalty that takes energy to do it, you need equipment and energy and that energy penalty can be it's on the average about 25% of the output. Let's say if you have a coal plant with carbon capture, it requires 25% of the electricity from the coal plant to run the carbon capture equipment. Now, just to give you an idea of how ridiculous this is, there is only one coal plant in the United States with carbon capture added to it. Now is in Thompson, Texas. It's called the Petra Nova project and they added carbon capture to the coal plant. But to run the carbon capture plant, they actually built a natural gas plant right next door to the coal plant. And now they mined new natural gas. They had to transport that gas. There's leakage of methane, there's emissions of pollutants and other chemicals due to the mining of the gas leakage or methane due to transport. And then there's combustion of the gas at the gas plants to generate electricity. And that combustion is not captured. So you have more air pollution. More carbon dioxide from the natural gas plant. They only captured over three years, 65% of the CO2 from the coal plant. And what did they do with that CO2? Well, they built a pipeline and piped it to a nearby oil field where the CO2 was then put into the oil field where it could bind with the oil so that it make the oil less dense. So you can get the oil come out faster, and then you burn more oil. Well, 40% of the CO2 that is captured goes right back. Yeah. So we did an analysis of that, that whole process actually not even including enhanced oil recovery, just up to the point of capture. And we found that because of the all the emissions from the gas plants and the upstream emissions of the coal mining and the low capture efficiency that only between. 11 and 20% of the CO2 that was emitted overall with this system was actually captured before and he has to oral recovery when he captured and has total recovery where 40% of what is captured is lost. Then we're talking about a 7 to 12% capture rate, which is ridiculous as a proposal to solve climate change. This was so inefficient it was shut down after three years. It cost $1 billion. We paid for that. Well, it's low income ratepayers because they pay the highest fraction of their income for electricity. So this is just a boondoggle. So carbon capture that's is one type of capture. The other type is called direct air capture, where? Similar technologies are used just to extract carbon dioxide from the air directly, while trees do that too. But trees do not require equipment or energy, they do it naturally. The problem with direct air capture is it also requires energy, similar to carbon capture, but it requires even more energy because carbon dioxide in the air is very dilute compared to an exhaust. So direct air capture has the same problems as carbon capture. They both increase air pollution. Oh, by the way, even if you ran the carbon capture equipment with wind, and this is where we looked at in this Petra, another plant, if you even run the carbon capture with wind. If you use that wind instead just to replace the coal, you would reduce more carbon than if you use the wind to run the carbon capture equipment. The same thing with direct air capture, even in the best case of using winds to power direct air capture equipment, you would reduce more carbon dioxide by taking that wind and replacing a fossil fuel source. So in other words, direct air capture and carbon capture always increased carbon dioxide, even in the best case of using renewable electricity. To power them compared with using that renewable electricity to replace its fossil sources so carbon capture direct air capture, increased CO2, they increased air pollution, they increased fossil fuel mining. And they increased fossil fuel infrastructure because you need more mining to run the carbon capture equipment. You need more infrastructure for the carbon capture equipment and the energy for it. And they also increase costs. So there's no benefit whatsoever. They're only designed to keep the fossil fuel industry in business. Blue hydrogen is just. Producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture so it has the same problems. Electrofuels is producing fuels to replace gasoline and diesel and. Fuel with synthetic fuels that are made from carbon dioxide from carbon capture, so they face the same problem. So none of those technologies is useful going forward. They're waste and delay tactics, and they do not help us solve the climate, air pollution or energy security problems we face.

Shawn
Ohhh yeah, I'm curious if you have thoughts about the greening of the economy beyond the energy system. There's a few proposals that we've heard about and talked about on the show over the last couple of years that come to mind. One of them is rewilding land is having effects on carbon capture, eliminating factory farming is another one proposed by one of our guests. And one of the things that we've talked about a lot is the creation of sort of like large scale Commons systems of, say, the library style management of public goods. Do you have any thoughts or insights on how these might have positive climate impacts or whether there's issues with them?

Mark
Well, so we're against what we call synthetic carbon capture and direct air capture, where you need equipment and energy. But we are for natural carbon capture. In other words, trees. So that includes not only reforestation growing more. Trees, but reducing deforestation, even that's even more important is reducing deforestation, because deforestation is done by burning in forests and that produces not only carbon dioxide, but also all the other pollutants, unfiltered other pollutants that cause health problems. So reducing deforestation is a significant way. Permanent deforest. And permanent deforestation is when you burn down a forest, for example, a rainforest, and you replace it with agricultural land. So you're taking high carbon intense land and converting it to low carbon intense land. And if we can eliminate a lot of that, that will save a lot of carbon dioxide, but also eliminate a lot of air pollution. So we're for reducing deforestation. Increasing reforestation. Now agricultural emissions, agriculture is responsible for a lot of emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Now a good portion of those emissions are associated with energy, and so we in our plans, we would eliminate the energy associated emissions from agriculture right away. But there are other emissions from agriculture that are not energy. Related, including methane emissions from like rice paddies, for example, the digestive tracts of sheep and cattle, and also not agriculture related but landfills. You get methane emissions because any environment where there's a lack of oxygen, you get what are called methanogenic bacteria that produce methane. And also in manure, there's methane emissions from that. So we need to address non energy emissions simultaneously with energy emissions. Well, there's also nitrous oxide from fertilizers too and other sources. So there are techniques to try to reduce the methane emissions and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture that need to be implemented as well. I mean, one for example is. From a newer digester where you dry out the manure and then you swirl it around in a digester to release the methane and the methane is captured in a bag, well, but you have to do something with that methane. Now, that's biogenic methane, what we call biogenic methane. And you can get methane, also some landfills, by putting pipes and landfills and capturing it in the same way. But what do you do with all this extra methane? Because we don't want to just release it to the air. Well, one thing that can be done is is to use it to produce hydrogen by process called steam methane reform. Doing which is already used worldwide, so steam methane reforming already exists, but just use that biogenic methane to produce hydrogen and they're only byproducts of that are carbon dioxide and trigger the amounts of chemicals. Then you have hydrogen that can be used in a fuel cell for energy without any emissions. And the CO2 at that point. Probably could be released to the air even though it's not going to be a large amount, but it's better to release CO2 to the air than messy. We don't want to take that CO2 and then try to. Use carbon capture equipment or pipelines to pipe it, because then that just defeats the purpose of building pipelines for CO2. But that's another problem with garbage. You need pipelines for it, but that it's better to release CO2 than methane, because methane 20 year time scale is about 86 times the global warming potential of Co. Two. So that would be. One thing to do with methane from agriculture, but. There are other niche sources of emissions that need to be addressed as well, like cement production, where half the emissions are from energy, which can be addressed through renewable energy. But the other half are what are called process emissions of CO2. Because you have calcium carbonate goes into cement production, but a simple solution. There's a company called Brimstone that does this. They just substitute basalt, which is a rock similar to calcium carbonate, but it doesn't have any carbonate in it, but it has calcium, so you can just substitute basalt for calcite and you eliminate your process emissions of CO2. That's one way to address cement.

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome to climate Anger Corner, where Sean and Aaron talked about this one study that we looked at the strength and content of climate anger which came out last year in 2023 about how anger affects peoples perceptions and actions towards climate change.

Aaron
In our anger episode, we were talking about. Anger is an effective motivating force, and so I was just thinking about climate anger. And was there any research on? And Googled it, found this study. It's pretty interesting. They broke down the different emotions people expressed in these interviews about climate change, and then they also broke down the different types of actions and behaviors that they participated in by the types of emotions expressed and then which behaviors they contributed to or not. And there was some really interesting. Stuff in there, the three types of behaviors that they measured were individual. Doing things like trying to take shorter showers or using less fuel personally, or trying to carpool, just anything where you're like, doing like individual behavior support for policy was the 2nd type of action that they measured and then. Engaging in activism was the 3rd type of action. So for anger specifically, they found that anger is not really associated with people doing individual behaviors. To try and mitigate climate change, but it is associated with policy support for climate change related policies. And it's like really, really associated with engaging in activism out of all the emotions they have here. Anger, sadness, fear, guilt and hope. Anger blew all the other emotions out of the water in terms of motivating people to engage in activism specifically, so that really kind of like matched our instinct. On that, unlike anger, being a motivating for, it doesn't seem to motivate people for everything, at least according to this one study. But in terms of activism specifically. It's like a huge motivating factor, like more than twice as much as the next highest one, which was fear.

Shawn
Yeah. And looking at these stats here and how they compare it is interesting. Fear and guilt are both pretty significantly associated with supporting policy actions, but fear is more associated with individual behavior. Like shorter showers, recycling, etcetera, where guilt and anger have very, very low correlations with individual behaviors. Which is weird because guilt. You would think guilt would motivate individual behaviors, but it appears not.

Aaron
Yeah. No, that was an interesting one. Yeah, that for individual. Behaviors, sadness and fear were the top ones and hope is also pretty close. And then guilt and anger like basically nothing, not really associated with it.

Shawn
And and hope it's pretty good for individual behavior and policy support. It's like a nice solid correlation, but it's significantly less connected with activism.

Aaron
It's actually the worst one out of all five of those emotions for activism.

Shawn
Yeah, it kind of makes sense in the way of like sometimes hope can be like a pacifying kind of like, oh, people are gonna figure it out kind of vibe. So it looks like a combo between hope and anger.

Speaker
Right.

Shawn
There might be one of the more potent mixes here, maybe a tinge of fear as well, but.

Aaron
Yeah, either hope. And anger or anger and fear, anger and one of the other ones, like even anger and sadness would be pretty good.

Shawn
Yeah, it looks it looks complementary. Sadness is really good for individual behavior for some reason. Yeah, we'll have a link in the description to our show notes for the study so you can look at this stuff in more detail. Yeah. It's it's really interesting to look at this survey out of Norway showing that the association between anger and activism blows every other association in this study out of the way. We're talking about a difference of almost twice as effective. Like anger is almost twice as effective as the second most pertinent correlation, which is fear and policy support.

Aaron
And anger is also really good for policy support. Not quite as good as fear, but the other interesting thing they did in this study was break down. The reasons people are angry about climate change. So the most people who are angry about climate change said that their anger came because of human actions. They're angry at the actions people are take. Thinking the second highest reason people were angry was being angry at specific agents like anger directed towards the people who are doing these actions. So it's a higher percent of people are angry about the actions than people who are angry, specifically at people. But that's the second highest one. Then when you break down the specific people that they're angry at, that was when I saw some really interesting things like the highest percentage, there is politicians and then the lowest percentage there is the rich or industry. Those are like 2 and 5% whereas politicians is 22%. And like I kind of get it, like politicians are the ones making the policy decisions. They're like the final say on that. But like, part of me is like, no, you're like, you're getting it. The reason those politicians are making those decisions is because of industry.

Shawn
And the rich? Yeah, I think it shows that there's room for. And I would assume that this funding in Norway holds up elsewhere. That there's room for public education and engagement on this stuff because it's no great secret that there's this widespread misconception. Climate change is caused by people in general doing bad things, and it's something that people should feel guilty about or misanthropic about. But a more careful analysis of what's happening in the world shows that the disproportionate power and resource uses of the wealthy and industry and their relationship with politics is the driver of climate change. And that's like. A social, ecological kind of insight that we could do more to engage people to understand because I'm hesitant to say, you know, they're wrong about what they're angry about. But 2% are saying that they're angry at the rich over climate change. And what is it? Like.

Aaron
22% in politics or I? Don't know which you're going to compare it.

Shawn
Yeah, I was thinking about the the qualities.

Aaron
Yeah, human qualities is, yeah, just below matted agents. And like the broader thing, broader things are mad about human qualities. So like, yeah, just thinking like humans.

Shawn
26% of people are mad at human nature and 2% are mad at the rich and poor.

Speaker
Suck.

Shawn
Powerful, which is just, it's wrong. It's a bad analysis.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah, I wonder if some of the people who are not mad at industry or the rich but are mad at politicians are like that because they have low expectations for industry and the rich. I I feel like I almost feel that a little bit where I'm like, Oh yeah, the rich in industry are going to, you know, we're patiently. Destroy the planet for profit. Of course. That's what they're going to do. Can't even be mad at them about it. They're like rabbit dogs just doing that. But politicians, they're the ones who are supposed to be stopping them, and they're not. Stop. Them so I can almost connect with it in that way, but they're not rabid dogs who are just they're human beings who are making decisions. So like, I think it's kind of. Letting them off the hook. To think that.

Shawn
Way I'm open to a general critique of politicians that we've made general critiques of politicians on the show, but one of the things that I don't like about that is like it's very specific groups of politicians that are the worst offense. Different politicians or offenders at different levels, right? And it might be a limitation of the survey, but the correlation and connections between the politicians and the industry is where the really sort of, you know, demonic stuff comes out for lack of a better.

Aaron
Term. Yeah. So quickly some of the other ones, about 13% of people are angry about consequences for nature. 11% are angry about. Consequences for. Humans, 10%, are angry about money, which, reading the study I think is talking about valuing money over the environment, over other concerns like the the sort of profit seeking mentality, 6% are angry about climate denial, and 3% are angry about not having control over the situation. All reasonable. Things to express anger about, and I also I just want to mention from what I understand, this wasn't like a survey where they. Like check off the things that make you angry and only a certain amount of people they were just interviewing people and then afterwards they coded the interviews to be like what did people spontaneously bring up themselves when talking about their feelings about climate change and.

Shawn
Whatnot. Right, right. So they could be, they could be angry about more of these things than just not they don't, they don't.

Aaron
It just, it just makes. The mind for them. Yeah, yeah.

Shawn
So yeah, having one in 10 people say that they're angry about people putting money ahead of the planet actually isn't.

Aaron
Yes.

Shawn
It doesn't mean that only 10% of them care about that. It's only 10% of them have it top of mind.

Aaron
Yeah, it's not that the other 90% were like ohh yeah, no, that's fine. Not angry. About that at all. And then yeah, they also correlated these different reasons for being angry with those other behavioral things. Again, individual policy support and activism. And in terms of that, the best thing for activism is people who are angry about valuing. Money over the environment, people who are angry about climate denial, people who are angry about lack of. Troll are the most likely people to engage in activism. Also, people who are blaming human qualities were up there too, but I found it interesting that the three best things for activism, money, denial, and lack of control were also the three lowest on the list of the amount of people who are angry about those things is kind of interesting.

Shawn
That's sad. What it means is that activists are very likely to bring those things up if you ask them an open-ended question about what they're angry about.

Aaron
Yeah, I guess that makes sense for sure, yeah.

Shawn
Because it's not necessarily cause. For tracking a correlation.

Aaron
Right. Right, right. It's not that being angry about those things causes activism necessarily. It could be that, yeah, activists end up thinking about those things more frequently. It also makes that activism maybe causes you to start having some doubts about human qualities, human nature, and maybe that's why, like, you know, you've been doing. Activism for a while you're getting ******* jaded about all these people who aren't listening to you. And maybe that's why they express anger about that.

Shawn
Again, it's not what I would advise and you know we you can listen to our show to hear more about our thoughts on that, but it's interesting anyway, so we'll have a link in the show notes to this if you want to check out. Study the strength and content of climate anger in the Journal of Global Environmental Change. Very interesting study.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah. Check it out. Now it's time for the old two meeting sketch.

Speaker 6
Mr. Senator, Sir, there's a meeting here. A constituent wants to.

Aaron
Is it time for that already?

Speaker 6
Wants to talk about energy transition.

Aaron
Yeah, I guess send them in.

Shawn
Hi, Mr. senator.

Aaron
Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Thank you so much for coming. We really, really appreciate hearing from you.

Shawn
Thank you for having me. So yeah, I guess the quick pitch is that I've been reading some stuff, some work by Marc Jacobson and others about doing a energy transition to 100% wind, water, solar.

Aaron
Ohh reading great.

Speaker 1
Energy.

Aaron
Yeah. Wow. Yeah, we're looking into that.

Shawn
So there's a bunch of benefits. Yeah, yeah, there's benefits on, like, my kid has asthma. Asthma is caused by particulates in the atmosphere caused by, well, not entirely caused by significantly contributed.

Aaron
Ohh. Oh no.

Shawn
To by this.

Aaron
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's awful.

Shawn
Well, thank you. But so, yeah, I'm. I'm thinking about the future kids too. And the wind, water, solar transition. You know, you save money on healthcare costs, it actually pays for itself over time. And we have to in the end, we actually have to use less energy cause so much energy is being used to extract fossil fuels. And get them to the right places. Burn combust. Not to mention the cost of some of these techno solutions people talk about like carbon capture and storage. That all requires energy. So the the energy costs of using oil are actually really much larger than they seem. And wind, water, solar. It's already being done in parts around the world and we could transition the whole world to it and we'd save a lot of lives and we'd have a a cleaner.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
Better environment for everyone. And yeah, so I was just hoping that you would support this and sort of a green New Deal type plan.

Speaker 1
We'll.

Aaron
Let me just say, first of all that I love the way you think. I love what you're saying. It's so refreshing just to hear, you know, new ideas and new plans like this coming up and.

Shawn
Thank you.

Speaker
Well, a lot.

Shawn
Of these, a lot of these ideas aren't even that new they they they first proposed the outline of this in 2008.

Aaron
Hmm. Right. Well, yeah. And the other thing I wanted to say is that children, and especially future children, are the future. And.

Speaker 5
It's.

Aaron
So stirring and moving to me to hear about your struggles with your child's asthma. And to think about the struggles of future children and you know, it's just. Thank you again so much. I can't stress enough how much I'm thanking you for coming to me with this and for talking to us with this, the one thing I will say is that there's a lot of barriers in place as to how quickly and how fast we can do. I'm on board 100%. But it's going to take time. There's a lot of committees, there's a lot of red tape, oil field workers, they have children too. And so we got to think about their livelihood. Don't want to, you know, have all their kids out on the street. So yeah, we're on board with what you're saying 100%. We just want to manage expectations. As to how quickly all this can happen, and you know some things are under our jurisdiction, some things are under the jurisdiction of the federal government or, you know, there's there's a lot going on. There's a lot of complex moving parts in this machine. But I just want you to know that we hear you. Most and foremost, and we thank you. We hear you and we thank you. It looks like I got time. I got another meeting coming right up. So I'm just gonna have to rush you kind of out the door.

Speaker 3
Well, thanks, I guess.

Shawn
Sure. So and just to be clear, was there a did you commit to push for this kind of stuff or?

Aaron
I've committed to hearing you, which I've done and I will relay what you said. I'm committing to relaying what you said to the relevant people to hopefully get the ball rolling on that soon.

Speaker 1
But. But you said you.

Shawn
I thought you said that you were 100%. Behind me, that doesn't sound like.

Aaron
I am 100% behind you and I'm I've committed to.

Shawn
But you're not 500.

Aaron
Trying to start the process of getting the ball rolling on beginning to look at what you're saying.

Speaker 3
But that's not.

Shawn
Like, that's not really 100%, that's like maybe 51 percent or some.

Aaron
Well, that's no, that's 100% that's that's 100%. So well, thank you again and goodbye.

Shawn
You're you're a progressive politician.

Aaron
Yeah. Ohh yeah, of course.

Speaker 6
Mr. Senator, we've got your 3:00 meeting.

Aaron
Ohh yeah, please send them in. My big oil CEO friend. That'll be refreshing after that first one there.

Speaker 1
Hey, *******. How you doing? Hey.

Speaker
You.

Aaron
Old *******. Come in and sit down. You want to drink?

Shawn
Gotta wipe that off your lip. You got a little.

Aaron
Poo poo on your lip. Hey, come on now. That's that's.

Shawn
Kissing ***** all day. I'm just kidding. Bad. Hey, put her there. That guy's kid was sick.

Aaron
Ohh yeah, you heard that you heard about that, yeah.

Shawn
Yeah. No, the kid was out there. He's.

Aaron
Coughing up a storm. Ohh. The kid was out there. Yeah, well, I'm glad he didn't bring the kid in. That would have been sad to look at. So he had to. Deal with that in the waiting room. But well, thank you. Well, you can make it up to me, but I always try to. I always try to. So yeah, the how's the oil and gas industry going boom business boom.

Shawn
You can make it up. Me. Ohh, tough time for us. A lot of these. Yeah, there's a lot of.

Aaron
Oh, sorry to hear that.

Shawn
Well, I'm just going to put a straight ideological terrorists, people who want nothing more than to destroy me, my children.

Aaron
MHM. That's what I was trying to explain to the last person. Like you have children too? Yeah. As the CEO of. Yeah.

Shawn
Many children, with many, many, many partners all around the world. Let's just say I get around. But yeah, so as I was saying tough, it's a really hard time for us right now with this, you know, green dream. App excuse my French. Pardon my Francais.

Speaker
Like.

Aaron
But you know, I'm committed to agreeing, and I'm a progressive politician. But you got to be realistic sometimes.

Shawn
So listen, I'm not gonna bite your ear off here today. I just bills going through the Senate right now. Some new subsidies. It's ****. You'll love. It's green oil and gas.

Aaron
Subsidies. Nice green oil and gas. That's now. That's something I can really. Work.

Shawn
With so yeah, we can get these squawking birds off of our back long enough that we can keep pumping and pumping and pumping it out of the ground and burning and burning and burning.

Aaron
But in the green? Yes, and pumping green burning. So how does that work? How is the green pumping and the green burning? If someone asked me to explain it, do you have like elevator?

Shawn
Pitch like how do you the first thing that we're going to do is we're hiring a graphic designer, so. Graphic designers will have a lot of green in their palette then I don't know if you've seen the color spectrum, but there's actually quite a.

Aaron
Bit of green in it, those color Wizards they can put.

Shawn
Green on anything. So we want an icon that's sort of like a leaf a little. Green leaf.

Aaron
Ohh yeah, I'll put it up by your logo or like next to a refinery.

Shawn
And then so. Yeah. So our logo.

Aaron
Yeah, right.

Shawn
You know, petrol extraction, burning for Energy LLC. We're going to color that one green and then we're going to get a little leaf next to it and it'll be a lighter green.

Aaron
So you need some subsidies to help pay for all those graphic designers.

Shawn
I mean graphic designers these days, I. You know, you know, don't do it for exposure anymore. Believe you me. Right. And then we're gonna be here to fracking. Yeah. So fracking is like another type of gas and it's greener in the sense that it's, I can't remember how it's greener, but just.

Aaron
Like fewer CO2, I.

Shawn
Think something like that. Yeah, but if you do it or not, it's the same. And then also we have to put the undisclosed chemicals underground to break things up. Down.

Aaron
There you just don't mention that.

Shawn
That's undisclosed for a reason. That's what I always like. Let sleeping dogs lie. Let undisclosed chemicals remain undisclosed. That's my philosophy. So I hope that answers all.

Aaron
Your questions? Yeah. No, that's totally that makes sense. And it's important for the economy. You guys are the backbone of the economy, right? As much as I would love to transition the fully renewables eventually.

Speaker 3
Well, how can you have it?

Shawn
How can you have a transition without an economy? That's.

Aaron
The thing exactly. Thank you.

Shawn
You talk to these green, green dream numbskulls these nutbags.

Speaker 3
And they're they'll they'll tell you.

Aaron
Trust me, I talk to him all.

Speaker 3
The time, and they're like, Oh my God, my kids got asthma. Ohh, won't somebody help?

Aaron
Me. Yeah. Well, would you like it better if your kid was living through the depression and they? They're like, right little puffs of dust come out when they turn their pockets inside out.

Speaker
Good.

Shawn
And they they don't even care about the birds that are hitting these.

Aaron
Spinning towels. Yeah. The birds hitting the windmills. It's all over the place. And like, have you seen solar panels on roofs? It just. It doesn't look as good as a shingle, I'll tell you that. It's kind of ugly. It's kind of creepy looking.

Speaker
Oh.

Shawn
Something. If these guys are flying around on planes and.

Speaker 3
They're and they're.

Aaron
Going to the climate conference, right?

Speaker 1
Right. Buying new shirts. There's.

Shawn
Excuse me? I thought you said we're in a climate crisis. Why don't you buy a new shirt? Are you an?

Aaron
Insane person. Do you wash all your clothes in the tub and don't use your washing machine to help save energy?

Shawn
Now you still using toilet paper? Well, isn't your hand just as good with no environmental impact?

Aaron
Yeah, you could just rinse it off in the toilet. Water after, yeah.

Shawn
Just on the other side of the toilet, from where the excretion?

Aaron
Was we're just up.

Shawn
In the tank in the tank. Ohh.

Aaron
Even that you know what, yeah.

Shawn
That's see, you gotta be designing this green stuff because you're pragmatist and that's why I always like coming.

Aaron
Through here? Well, I'm not saying I would do that. I'm saying if you don't do that and then you come and criticize the oil and gas industry, it doesn't really make sense. To me anyway, I don't know. Yeah. Well, this has been an extremely productive meeting. I'm so happy to hear you guys are going green.

Speaker 6
Well, thank you.

Aaron
With that new color palette, that's just great. So yeah, I will try to get those subsidies expedited as quickly as, but no. Sorry, I'm not gonna try to get those subsidies expedited as quickly as possible. I will get those subsidies expedited immediately. That's my top priority. I'm behind it 10,000%. It's gonna happen.

Shawn
Thank you. Correction please. You jump for me.

Aaron
Ohh yeah sure. Any particular height you'd like me to jump to? How high?

Speaker 6
About four and a half.

Aaron
Inches or now. Oh yeah, that's easy. I jump that high anytime for. You there you go. Is that enough? You want me to?

Shawn
Keep doing it, keep doing it, but I gotta. Go bye.

Aaron
Everybody thanks stopping by.

Shawn
For I hope you're jumping the next time. I stop in here, you son of a.

Speaker 1
*****, I'll be jumping the.

Aaron
Whole time, you crazy *******. I love. You love you.

Speaker 1
Too. See you at the ranch.

Aaron
And that was the old two meeting sketch.

Shawn
On the subject of money, it's transitioning to an electrified system when water, solar. Is that an expensive undertaking? How does it fit into the economic system? And when this is being pitched to governments and stuff like that, they're going to look at their budgets. On a year to year basis, even more than they look at the, the the sort of sustainable biosphere of the planet and so on. It appears so what's the economics of this sort? Plan.

Mark
Well, we calculate that worldwide it would cost on the order of a little over $60 trillion. Sounds like a lot, but if you look at it from an annual cost point of view, I mean right now the world spends about $11 trillion per year on energy by 2050, that's expected to go up to about $17 trillion or so per year. And by the way, on top of that, then you have health costs. So the seven and a half million air pollution deaths per year, that's about $30 trillion per year in cost in terms of what's called the value of statistical. And it's a parameter the government set. What they what do they value people's lives at? It's about each person's life, depending on the country, you know, could be anywhere from $3,000,000 to $15 million a person, but average worldwide. When you account for the death rates due to air pollution, we're talking about $30 trillion per year. And climate costs based on the social cost of carbon anticipated in 2050 or also another $30 trillion per year. So if you look at the 2050 energy cost in a business as usual scenario with fossil fuels of $17 trillion per year plus another $60 trillion per year for health and climate costs, that's about $77 trillion. Here. Well, wind, water, solar eliminates health and climate costs. So it eliminates 60 trillion right there and it reduces energy demand by about 56%. But it also reduced the cost per unit energy by another 15%. So we're it's about a 63% lower annual cost of energy. So instead of $17 trillion per year, we're down to about $7 trillion per year. So it's $10 trillion per year difference in energy costs. So just ignore the health and climate cost. There's $10 trillion per year. Difference in the energy cost? If the total cost is $60 trillion up front, divide that by $10 trillion per year savings. It's a payback time of six years. We can transition the. Entire world for. All purposes and get a payback in six years of the energy cost alone when we account for the health and climate cost benefits, we're talking to payback time of less than one year. Because we basically, instead of $77 trillion per year in energy plus health plus climate plus in a fossil fuel. Case we have a $7 trillion per year total, so that's $70 trillion per year savings. That means $60 trillion upfront cost, $70 trillion per year savings. That's less than a one year payback time with wind, water so. So it's just the most obvious thing to do in terms of saving money. In terms of not only direct consumer cost savings, but also health cost savings, climate cost savings. In addition to job creation and reducing land use and also providing renewable energy in perpetuity.

Shawn
So wind, water, solar looks superior to alternative energy options. Based on this discussion and reading the book. But are are there, like negative externalities like for example? I know that when large scale water plants are installed off and there's large amounts of land that are flooded, cultural or environmental impacts could be part of these like large scale dams. Another thing that's frequently brought up is the. Intermittency of. Solar and wind power just in the interests of providing a full picture on the genuine challenges that we face. Like, what do you think are the biggest challenges to these energy systems? It's sort of like negative externalities that we need to find ways to overcome and and to what degree do we know how to overcome them?

Mark
Well, ideally we would not add anything to an environment, no wind turbine, solar panels, hydro dams or batteries or anything. But we do have to provide our energy somehow. So we want to take the least invasive technologies and least cost and least pollute. And and that's when water. Solar is that now in terms of hydropower, our plans involve no new large hydro dams. We use existing hydro dams exclusively. And so that is not an issue going forward. But there are issues like yeah, the wind does not always blow, the sun doesn't all shine. So that's why we need to combine storage with. Generation, so battery storage, hydroelectric. The nice thing about existing hydro dams is they provide electricity storage. They're in fact the largest source of storage in the world, and the second largest existing electricity storage in the world today is pumped hydro storage and then batteries that are growing in popularity and will probably overtake the other two worldwide at some point. So storage, but also what's called demand response. So there's the supply of energy, but there's also the demand for energy. We can shift the time of the demand for energy by minutes to hours. Then you can actually match the intermittent supply better. You know, solar peaks during the day obviously. But if you can shift the night time electricity use toward the daytime when you have a lot of solar on the grid, that's called demand response. Or in other cases like right now, most demand for electricity is in the late afternoon, early evening, and that's when electricity prices are highest. But so if you can shift the demand to later at night. So let's say we have a lot of electric vehicles instead of charging them in the late afternoon. What if we give people incentives to charge them late at night and then you can actually match? Demand was supplied better and lower the cost of. Energy. And also over generation, sometimes it's better just to build more wind and solar than we need to provide extra energy that can either be stored. Used or converted to heat or converted to hydrogen like electrification of all energy sectors makes the problem easier to solve because we have more what are called flexible demands like producing hydrogen. We don't need to produce hydrogen at the same time it's used, we can produce the hydrogen then store it. So when you have extra electricity you can use some of that. Electricity to produce hydrogen you can use some of that extra electricity to produce heat. The heat can be stored in water or underground, and that's the case where have extra electricity then then some of that extra electricity will be stored in electrical storage and then when we don't have enough electricity. Well then, that's when we come from electricity storage. To use that, we have interconnections with other regions, so grid interconnections, so we import more electricity from other regions and we use demand response to try to shift the time of electricity use. Well, anyway, we found that with all these techniques we can solve the problem every 30 seconds for multiple years. Everywhere worldwide we've looked at 149 countries now and have no problem keeping the grid stable, continues. So.

Shawn
You mentioned before, 2023 is the hottest year on record globally, so it's clear we're facing a very urgent crisis on the climate front, you know, and how many million does it die per year because of the pollution impacts? It's.

Mark
Almost seven and a half million people.

Shawn
Seven, yeah, geez, that's a lot of human beings. Your original. The article in Scientific American was 2009. So if a baby was born when it was published, they'd be almost graduating college now. Or maybe graduating college.

Mark
It hurts. Closer to 15 years old.

Shawn
Oh yeah, did I get my math wrong? Oh, I did. Yeah. OK, well, that's good. If a baby was born, then they they would be in high school now or there's some sort of genius, some sort of highly advanced genius. Like I said, I'm not a morning person with your experience with having this time pass and interacting also with policymakers and stuff like that. And there's the entrenched power of the fossil fuel. Industry and they're sort of the political inertia dragging feet from one term to the next. So on do you have any political takeaways on the challenge of the political will because you mentioned that there's a technological issue, there isn't an economic issue, there's just a political issue and we could be a lot further along by now if there was less of those political issues and you ever worry, for example, we're going to be. You know another 15 years from now, and we're gonna be looking back on all the things that could have been done that haven't been done and we're halfway through building a bunch of nuclear plants or something. And like, yeah, so, any any reflections on the political process, the political inertia and and those. Which is.

Mark
Well, I think the biggest part we're facing is the competition among ideas. There's a policy that goes back to the Obama administration called it all of the above policy. Let's just try everything and hope something works. And this is really what's led to the pushing of nuclear carbon capture, direct air capture, blue hydrogen, electric fuels, bioenergy. Even solar radiation management, which is geoengineering, you know, we've evaluated all these technologies and find that they're not helpful at all. In fact, they're harmful for trying to solve the problem. Yet in the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, about 40% of the funding goes for these useless endeavors. And so this is the big danger we face because. In fact, in the last comp meeting, several countries pledged to triple the amount of nuclear power. So they're going to spend a lot of money trying to increase nuclear power worldwide, but this will never happen. I mean, the economics are so bad and the time lags are so bad that you can have all the goals in the world, but you'll never get much nuclear put up even in the next 15 to 20 years. And we need to solve 80% of the problem in six years. So it's going to be useless, but they're going to put a huge amount of money and waste that money, prevent that money from actually being used to deploy much faster deploying solutions that are much cheaper. And so that's what's slowing us down. It's just a distraction. We're being distracted by technologies that are not helpful at all for solving the problem. Again, their nuclear power, small or large carbon capture, direct air capture, blue hydrogen, electric fuels, bioenergy, geoengineering. These are not useful technologies at all, and they're harmful for actually solving air pollution. Climate change. And energy security problems we face.

Shawn
Yeah, fascinating. Well, this was an awesome interview. I've learned a lot here between reading your book and this discussion. I really appreciate you coming on for our audience. Any any closing thoughts on this transition we have ahead of us and what people should be looking to and thinking about.

Speaker 5
The.

Mark
Well, I want to end on an optimistic note. I think we have 95% of the technologies we need and most of these technologies are really highly commercial and and low cost and can be deployed right away and we can solve the problem. The numbers show that we can solve these problems at low cost, create jobs, save consumers money, reduce health and environmental damage. Manage and reduce land use even. We just need to focus on what works. Keep our eye on the ball, deploy, deploy, deploy as fast as possible, not get distracted by things that don't work, and so I would just stay positive and suggest people stay positive and just focus on the goal.

Shawn
Awesome. Yeah. Well, thanks so much again. And yeah, I don't know why I added a I carried A1 there when I was thinking about this hypothetical baby that just was never there in the first place. But I'm going to keep that in, you know, it's important to let the listeners know that even podcast hosts aren't perfect.

Mark
I did that too when I was adding up the the present day plus the how long a nuclear reactor took. We're all human.

Shawn
So. So the book is no miracles needed, very readable and very in-depth book. There's a lot of things covered that we didn't talk about. I'd have time to talk about. So definitely go check that out. Yeah. And thanks again. It is a great pleasure to speak to you.

Mark
Yeah. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it. And look forward to the final result.

Shawn
Yeah. So there you have it. Our interview with Marc Jacobson.

Aaron
Looks like a better world is possible. Not only possible, but we gotta plan.

Shawn
Yeah, we know it's possible because it's already happening, not at the rate that we need, not as much as we need. And then also, there's the political interference at the oil and gas industry. You know, Mark handled the hope. Let's get into the anger. Now, as you might know, 2024 is the year of righteous. Positive utopian anger. That's seriously wrong last year was the year of the bonus episode. Each year we try to get some sort of abstract thing, you know, anger has a real purpose in politics. It incites people to action. I got angry about the industrial accident in Vancouver and myself and some friends. We got a letter writing campaign going. That's anger work. For you.

Aaron
Yeah, anger is self protective. It causes you to take actions to stop the thing that is making you be like, no, I don't like this. It's making me angry. That's kind of the point of the.

Shawn
Emotion. Yeah. And there can be too much and it can be maladaptive in certain circumstances. Or there could be secondary effects that you need to sort of keep under wraps or moderate. But I think when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

Aaron
Ohh yeah, yeah sure.

Shawn
We should be angry, so I'll go a little further than Professor Stanford Professor Marc Jacobson on this. I am really ******* angry at the oil and gas industry killing people with impunity for. Decades and destroying and baking our planet, burning the planet up, destroying our home, destroying nature, destroying the biodiversity of our planet, destroying. Homes, forests, jungles, the oceans. I think we really need something like a truth and reconciliation Commission on climate, and we need to hold these firms accountable. We need to seize their assets and their beneficiaries assets to some great degree. Maybe I'm just ****** ***, but I think the oil and gas industry is killing us and then they're putting little Facebook ads in my feed. Or whatever. Like Ohh, we're doing clean oil now. This is our green. We put a little green leaf next to it and we use combustion based energy and we put a little green leaf net. To it and your child will choke and get asthma. Isn't it nice?

Aaron
Green choking green asthma.

Shawn
And yeah, 2023 was the hottest year on record. 2024 is not going to be, you know, major reverse of the trends. It's time to get a little angry, you know, not everything's dough. Not everything's always positive. Not not. Everything's not always gonna work out in the end. Sometimes you gotta like, go God. No. Within reason, of course. Like you shouldn't treat other people that way, but institutions we should be furious with. I don't know. Maybe I'm overdoing this anger if I actually don't feel like angry right now, I could work myself up by talking about it. But actually.

Speaker 3
So. Right.

Shawn
Yeah, maybe just want to do like sort of a little bit of a. Wrap up spiel and then I'll look at what do you mean.

Aaron
What? Our. Wrap up feel like.

Shawn
Like this is the end of the episode. Thanks again to our patrons. We'll be back soon.

Aaron
Thank you so much for everybody for listening this week. Thank you to Marc Jacobson for coming on doing this great interview.

Shawn
Hearing this now, I'm starting to think maybe it shouldn't be the year of anger. Maybe it should be the year of gratitude. Because that gratitude was so powerful.

Aaron
Well, you can be both. You can be grateful and angry at the same time.

Shawn
So our year of both anger and grate.

Speaker 1
Dude 2 great tastes that go great together.

Aaron
Yeah, it's like salt and pepper. It's yeah, vanilla ice cream and olive oil.

Shawn
That's the new peanut butter. Chocolate. Have you had that? I saw someone post a picture.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah, it's. I haven't tried it, but I saw it also on.

Shawn
Seems intuitively like not a thing.

Aaron
Well, I don't know. It seems good to me. I don't. Know I would try it I. Mean. I like both of them. Yeah, they also mentioned salt salting it, and I like salting sweet things in general.

Shawn
Ohh yeah, it makes it sweeter. They say that's an old baking.

Aaron
Trick. It also makes it slightly salty, which is good.

Shawn
Well, yeah, it depends how much you.

Aaron
But like you get those like salted caramel cookies with like the chunk lake of salt on the top, and you get that little burst of salty taste. Yes, yes.

Speaker
So so yeah.

Shawn
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got gratitude for that. And I've got anger to the people who take.

Speaker 1
It from me.

Shawn
But actually anger and gratitude, you know, it is kind of a nice pairing. It does it. They balance each other out a little bit, the right anger at the right time for the right reasons, the right gratitude at the right time for the right reasons. It's kind. Of being in balance.

Aaron
Everything. Absolutely. Yeah. It's all emotions, baby. You need all of them.

Shawn
Oh well, sound off from the comments people. What do you think about Marc Jacobson's wind, water, solar plan and what do you feel angry about and what do you feel gratitude for? Tell us all three in one post.

Aaron
You have 1231. This is what I think of the Plan 2. This is what I'm angry about 3 this is what?

Shawn
I'm grateful for and. Do you have any sort of hybrid? Gratitude. Anger, stories that you can share with us, Hideo Kojima, the guy who created Metal Gear Solid and death. Thing he said that great art is art that makes you feel two things at once. So maybe this week's episode was great art. If it made you angry and gracious.

Aaron
Well, if you're angry at the fossil fuel industry for poisoning the air, but grateful to Marc Jacobson for doing all this work thinking about what the solutions are and like doing the research, breaking the numbers down, that's it makes perfect.

Shawn
Sense. Yeah. It's like a sweet cookie with little pieces of salt in it. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, guys. I'm not sure if I can stay angry that long, but we'll try again.

Aaron
To me.

Shawn
Next week.

Aaron
Ohh for a whole year.

Shawn
For a whole year.

Speaker 1
Just pure anger.

Aaron
Like you don't have to own. Like we didn't only do bonus episodes the year of the bonus episode. You can do like.

Shawn
True. Yeah, I'm grateful for that insight. And I'm angry I didn't come up with it.

Speaker 3
Myself.

Aaron
Thank you so much for listening everybody. We will see you again next.

Shawn
Time and if you didn't listen.

Speaker 3
Girl, I'm mad at you.

Aaron
Just skip straight to the end.

Shawn
Yeah, yeah, I guess I won't hear.

Aaron
It you're right, I always listen to the last 20 seconds of a podcast.

Shawn
And that's it. If I refuse to listen to it, I just wanna. Hop right there.
