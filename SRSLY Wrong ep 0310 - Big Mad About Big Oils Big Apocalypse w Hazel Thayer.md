Hazel
Warning the inside is inside of the outside. 

Speaker 2
You're seriously. You're seriously. You're seriously. seriously 

Shawn
Hello everybody and welcome to the seriously wrong angry cast for the year of anger as we're talking about climate anger is a recurring theme and I'm feeling. I'm not. I'm feeling angry. 

Aaron
Hey, every time you talk about how it's anger year, I just start laughing immediately. It makes me like the complete opposite of angry. 

Shawn
So if by the end of this episode you do not feel any anger, we have not done our job, even though we're going to be bringing levity to it. Obviously, as we always do. But there's things that are worth being angry about in this little world of ours, and one of the things that's worth being angry about is that the people who caused the climate crisis, you know, often the climate crisis is blamed on on, on just everyone humanity as such, you know, well, we did all the wrong things. We should. We burned all this oil, our bad. 

Aaron
We're all just making. Choices individually. 

Hazel
We're we're the plague, actually. 

Shawn
Yeah, we're the virus. No, there are people. There are organizations that are responsible for this, that we're going to be talking about today. Some of them. And there are people with authority who made decisions and had the information to stop this and didn't. But first, before we get into that, we are joined by Hazel. 

Hazel
Yeah. 

Shawn
There a. Climate video maker how is that how you would describe a climate content creator on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube podcasts in the future? 

Hazel
Yeah. Yeah, they, yeah. New new on YouTube. Yes, someday a podcast. Thank you. Yeah, hi. Hi, guys. Long time listener, first time caller. Thanks for having me on the show. 

Shawn
Yeah, our pleasure. Well, and welcome to our recording studio, Aaron's living room. 

Hazel
Yeah, it's beautiful. 

Aaron
Here it's pretty good living room for recording in high ceilings. 

Hazel
Just columns everywhere. How? Much. Do you guys get paid for? 

Aaron
Yes. 

Hazel
That Patreon money? No, I'm kidding. I'm. Kidding. 

Aaron
Very classical Roman building design, yeah. 

Shawn
So we're talking today about how we got where we are in terms of the climate crisis here in the year 2024, after decades and decades of opportunities to go in a different direction and who and what may be responsible for such a trajectory. Here's an interesting little quote. The President of the American Petroleum Institute addressed industry leaders at the API's annual meeting in 1965, repeating findings from U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's report restoring the quality of our environment and concluding there is still time to save the world's peoples from the catastrophic consequences of pollution. But time. Is running out. 

Hazel
Can we get a year on that 1965? 

Shawn
1965. But it goes back even further. Believe it or not, 1965 wasn't when people first figured out that climate change may be caused by oil and gas being, but. And but actually in the mid 1950s, the Southern California Air Pollution Foundation received funding from the oil and gas industry and the automotive industry to study smog and came to an early conclusion that the possible consequences of a changing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with reference to the climate may ultimately prove of considerable significance. The civilization that's 1954. 

Hazel
Then what? Then what? 

Shawn
Well, in 1959, I'm glad you asked at the oil and Man Symposium, which was organized by the American Petroleum Institute. And so for people who aren't aware the American Petroleum Institute is one of the largest industry groups of the oil and gas industry and component aspects of the American Petroleum Institute. Include all of our favorite gas stations, all of our favorite oil and gas producers, so they're present at these things, their leadership as President, these things, and this is back. Ohh, back in 1959. You know The Beatles hadn't made their ways to the shore of of the United States yet you know everything. 'S in black and white. 

Hazel
This is the oil and man symposium. 

Shawn
Symposium. 

Hazel
Ohh yeah, I couldn't be there. I was at the women for Natural Gas Symposium. Sorry, we'll get there eventually. 

Shawn
So this was the 100th anniversary of the oil and gas industry and everyone was there, all of your favorite oil barons had made it out, and Edward Teller, a nuclear physicist. Just addressed the address the organization and said whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide has a strange property, it transmits visible light, but it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect, and it has been calculated that a temperature rise. Corresponding to a 10% increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the ice cap in submerge New York. 90. 59 and you know 1960196519701977, we could go into all the details of all this stuff, but here's the headline. We are living through a continual process of attempted murder where the oil and gas industry is conspiring to kill all of us in order to make money year. After year and so climate change became a public issue in the late 1980s, there was discussions about it before then, but there was a series of. I think it was in 1988 there was a series of hearings in the United States congressional hearings, and there was also soon after was the foundation of the IPCC. I think in 1991. So climate change really became a public issue in the late 80s and 19 early 1990s, for decades before the oil and gas industry had information that their product was causing the warming of the planet. Would be catastrophic consequences and what they chose to do with that information instead of working to stop it instead of raising alarm bells instead of pivoting to other sources of energy because another piece of context here is that energy. Is quite expensive usually, except for burning fossil fuels, the amount of energy you get out of burning fossil fuels is on an order of magnitude way higher than the other. Other types of energy in terms of investment versus payout. So there's a lot of money in oil and gas, and so they made the decision to instead of working to address these things. That they would fund this information, they would fund lobbying and they would create a rift in society between people who understand reality and people who are deluded for profit. This is like the greatest crime of the 21st century. You know, like this is actually genuinely. Something that. Could throw humanity off, of course, for hundreds of years, and they did it because they wanted yachts. They did it because they wanted bunkers. They did it because they wanted more money. 

Hazel
It's just a it's just a trolley problem, but on one track is a pile of money and the other track is everybody alive. 

Aaron
We're gonna save that money. 

Hazel
Gotta save that money, guys. We can use that money to rebuild society after we destroy it. 

Aaron
That precious money. 

Shawn
So that's the basic context. We can. We can talk about it. I just, I had this inside me. I've been reading about this and it actually really ****** me off. Because I don't want to die, I don't want other people to die. I want there to be a nice world outside. And you ever, like, go to a park and see all the kids playing and kind of like, wonder what their future is going to be like. Well, the oil and gas guys did that and. They were like. Who ******* cares, man? That ****** me. 

Aaron
Off they're like, well, we don't know. We can't. We can't know for sure whether that's gonna happen. Like you have a crystal ball. Can you predict the future? 

Hazel
Yeah, there actually is a quote. I'm going to have to find a source for it but it. The many of these decisions were not made because they were, quote, beyond the lifetimes of contemporary decision makers. So who are we to make decisions for future generations? 

Aaron
Yeah. As if like continuing to pump CO2 into the atmosphere isn't the decision you're making for future generations. Now that's just like the neutral non decision that, you know, it's normal, but deciding not to do it, that would be infringing on their decision rights to do. Yeah. What a weird statement. 

Speaker
Cool. 

Speaker 2
MHM. So. 

Shawn
We now go to three oil executives. 

Aaron
It's a beautiful day at the park, isn't it? Look at all these children playing. Don't you just love seeing the joy in their little faces and thinking about the future that we're building for them? 

Shawn
Yeah. When I'm about to make a big decision within my role at the oil and gas industry, I like to look at the sweet eyes of children playing at the playground, imagining their whole life ahead of them, their family, everything that they could be all that potential there. And then I like to think of that as I'm making a decision to prioritize our short term profits over the long term. Health of the environment and the planet, and sort of just image. And their future being sort of taken away or burned away from them for me to make money. And that's that's my process. Just a little advice as as one CEO to another. 

Hazel
When I see the beautiful face of a little child, I just sort of imagine it being like a skin bag around just a bunch of money. And I just think about how much money could that be, you know, just. Your kids, if you if you just. Shredded them up. How much money? Would that be? 

Aaron
Yeah, turn them into soup of some. Kind or Yum. 

Hazel
Love Childs. 

Aaron
Sometimes I imagine the air becoming so thick with. That their little bright faces are just snuffed. Out and how much profit would come into my company from pumping all that smog into the environment? And I just. 

Shawn
That's absolutely right. 

Aaron
Think. 

Hazel
Being classically economically trained as I am, when I look at any human being, actually I see a dollar value over their heads. Don't worry boys, yours is very high. But I look at. Those kids and I think. 

Aaron
Hey, guys. 

Hazel
2 bucks 200 bucks at best, depending on how much they. 

Aaron
Consume. I mean, if you think about how much value they actually have to a company. Me. Like I wouldn't even pay that child $1.00 an hour because they wouldn't bring in that much value as an employee. They're completely useless as employees so. 

Shawn
No, they're toddlers. 

Hazel
The government won't let us send them to the coal mines anymore, just more nanny state nonsense. So what are they good for? Getting poisoned with smog? That's what I say, boys. 

Aaron
Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker
MHM. 

Shawn
It's funny, you mentioned them being bags of money because that's almost exactly true is when we make these decisions. And then the children die of otherwise preventable causes. It's almost as if they explode in a little proof of money that directly goes into our bank accounts and are through our holdings exploded like a a little money pinata. 

Hazel
Like a little money pinata. 

Aaron
And then people whining. Ohh care about the children the well. Maybe if we could still employ them in the coal mines. But you took that away from us so. 

Hazel
They don't want us to employ the children, but they want us to care about the children. I just don't see. 

Aaron
This is all that's left. 

Hazel
How this is efficient? 

Shawn
And whatever happened to reciprocity? I mean, do these children care about me and my prophets? I mean, am I supposed to just? Give and give and give until I'm no more for these children and their sweet, innocent faces and pour from an empty cup. Turn myself inside out and sacrifice myself at the altar of these sweet children's faces who just dream of having a regular future. No, no. I have to explode them like money pinatas to boost my stock value. 

Aaron
Look, if they want to fix the environment when they're older. Then, good luck. Godspeed to them and I want to make things too easy. 

Shawn
Of course I support that, yes. On them and be very inspiring. Exactly. Yeah. But for now, no quarterly profits, of course. Exploding in little money, pinatas. 

Aaron
Anyway. 

Hazel
This whole country was founded on the concept of children exploding into money pinatas. I don't see why we'd change it just because of something called global warming. 

Aaron
And that was three oil executives having a conversation in the park. 

Shawn
Here's an interesting quote in July of 1977, research and engineering scientists at Exxon, James Black informed Exxon's management committee, backed by swaths of research that had been done by Exxon's research and Engineering department, that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies. Might become critical 1977 five years Exxon management committee. The interesting thing about looking into this generally is the incredible amount of it. It's like it's not just like, oh, we've got this one document, it's like they were warned and they didn't do any. They shuffled it away. And they're like, no. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
No, no, no. I don't believe it. 

Aaron
Yeah, right. If there's only one document, you could be like, oh, maybe they didn't really read it or they didn't take it seriously or they didn't, like, believe it, or, you know, but if it's like multiple documents every few years for decades and like, all their scientists are saying. And they're taking steps to take climate change into account on other things. And they're like, I watched this documentary called how the oil companies hid the truth about climate change, and they interviewed this guy, Edwin Clark, who's an ex Exxon employee, and he's talking about how in 1970, they're building the. Transasia pipe? Line and they were building it in an area where there's permafrost, but they were like, thinking, hey, with this climate change stuff, the permafrost might not be so perma like it might start melting. And that'll affect how we need to anchor this pipeline to the ground. If the ground starts not being frozen anymore, we need to engineer it differently to make sure that the pipeline. Yes. So they're like, OK, we'll, we'll design this so that it works both in permafrost and also not in permafrost conditions. This is in 1970, their own scientists are like, oh, we're taking into account that climate change is going to happen. We want to make sure our pipeline keeps working even once the permafrost is gone. So yeah, they weren't just like, ohh yeah, they're just missing these reports like, yeah, don't do anything about it. They're like scientists, the people designing their infrastructure were specifically building things so that they could work with climate change. The other one I have is people can't see. But there's this platform thing. It's called the troll. A platform in Norway. And there's other ones like this. There's just the one I have the picture of. It's like an out at sea platform. It's raised a little bit up above the ocean on these big column. And you can see the like high tide versus low tide of it. But they when they built it in 1989, just before they started construction, they announced they were raising it an extra 2 meters from what they had originally planned. Just so that, you know, kind of future proofing it for once sea levels rise or there's, like, more climate events, we're going to raise it up just a little bit more. When we initially said we were going to and there's a bunch of examples about there, there's other things like that in Canada, there's oil rigs in Alaska that were designed for ice sheet. What? What's the? What does it say? Pack ice being thinner in the future. 

Hazel
Does that make it easier to get through the ice? Is that I remember reading something like that where it's like, oh, we plan on the ice being easier to drill through. In the future is that. 

Aaron
Yeah, I think it. I think it's that they had said like we if the pack ice is thinner then we don't need to build this any more robustly than for the conditions right now because we know the pack guys isn't going to get any thicker at least. And there was also a thing about like driving an oil tanker through. 

Speaker 4
Fact Check me. 

Aaron
Part of Alaska, they were wondering if they could get like a new route once the ice starts melting and they had like built this tanker to like break through the ice. I don't have the details on that one. I forget it, but it's just a bunch of **** like that. Like they were wow publicly either not talking about it in, like, the 70s, no one was talking about it. So they just weren't bringing it up. Publicly or once it became a public issue and they're funding disinformation against it, like during all of that time, they're also on the back end taking it very seriously in terms of, like their investments on oil rigs and pipelines. 

Shawn
So this platform where they added two meters to it to be ready for sea level rise, that's 1989 you said. 

Aaron
1989. Yeah. And the yeah, it's like an LA Times article where they say specifically that they said they were raising at 2 meters because of climate change like they. Specifically said, that's why they were doing it. 

Shawn
That's really interesting because in 1989 Shell joined the Global Climate Coalition GCC, which was an industry lobbying group which opposed action to reduce CO2. Emissions and so doubt about the science of climate change. But Despite that, in 1995 the GCC produced an internal document called predicting future climate change, a primer which said the scientific basis of the greenhouse effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied. While they were out denying it. 

Hazel
We're talking about in 1989, I got a 1989. Fact. Excellent. That same year that they're raising up the platform to prepare for climate change, Exxon spearheaded an international industry group, developed a strategy to block policy on 149 climate bills. This document from 1989. I'm. 

Shawn
Ohh, you're talking about the international petroleum industry Environment Conservation Association. 

Hazel
Talking about. You're right and I was reading IP AKA and I was like wish. I knew what that stood for. 

Aaron
In this LA Times article, where they're talking about the platform they actually like asked, I can't remember which company. I don't have the quote here, but basically they were like, hey, why were you doing one thing with your infrastructure and then like publicly opposing all these bills and like saying it's not true and thing and they were like, it's not really a contradiction because you want to be. Extra cautious when dealing with any possible outcome when building something like this. But when you're talking about public policy, you want to be really cautious to like, not over regulate things when there's no need to. So it's just being cautious in both cases. But I guess like being really cautious about different things or in different directions to benefit your own company. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Shawn
Yeah, sounds like they were full of **** around. 

Hazel
Sounds like they were trying to. 

Aaron
Yeah, yeah. 

Hazel
True sounds like they were trying to emphasize scientific uncertainty while also emphasizing the economic cost of fossil fuel controls. Insisting on more research before action and promoting false solutions. 

Aaron
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

Shawn
Yeah. So there was a set of there's a set of tools that were developed across the 1970s, eighties and 90s for how these communication strategies might go forward and what you're just talking about is some of these strategies. One of the things that they would pretend is that they care about it too, and they're a good faith partner. And in fact, they're going to fund science research institutes. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
So groups like Exxon could be experts who sit at the table and say we know climate change better than anyone, and we're your partner in fighting. Climate change and another thing that they figured out in the 1970s is that you can blame everyone. You can blame civilization itself, the inextricable twirling of progress towards freedom just invariably causes the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to rise and rise and rise until the ice caps melt. Until you get wild weather patterns. And so. So on and in the 1980s, they innovative some even more great rhetorical strategies like climate change is uncertain. Not everyone agrees the models aren't perfect. So you have 9 models which all say the same thing, and then you have one outlier model that has some sort of weird assumption and doesn't make sense. And you're like, it's this crazy thing we're just trying to figure it out. 

Hazel
And and meanwhile, well, while emphasizing the scientific uncertainty, the main things that they would present to, you know, U.S. Congress to say whether or not we should. Regulate fossil fuels. Believe it or not, their position is that we shouldn't regulate fossil fuels and so they would. Yeah. So. 

Shawn
I'm glad they're looking out for everyone. 

Hazel
They're making. They're making sure that we're making the right policy decisions, but with policy, see what you got to look at is the economic ramifications of it. And economics is a lot easier to skew than science. And so a lot of their reports say, oh, well. We had our. Economists look at the scientific data. And even if the scientists are right and it's bad, it will only affect, you know, 10% of the economy or 3% of the economy. 

Shawn
Ohh thank God. 

Hazel
And not mentioned that that 3% contains agriculture where we get our food from. 

Aaron
I wonder if that would have knock on effects to the other 97% of the economy. 

Hazel
Well, I mean, I don't get my food from agriculture. I get my food from the grocery store, which is inside, so it should be OK. 

Aaron
Probably not. Right. Yeah, yeah. If you're just if it's inside, then who cares if it's warm outside? Yeah, because you could just run an air conditioner. 

Hazel
Just refrigerate the produce guys. 

Aaron
Yeah, exactly so. 

Shawn
At one point, these pieces of **** figured out. That they can look like they're doing something by studying it over and over again and funding. We've got all these studies about climate change. We're just double, triple, quadruple checking. It's so hard to know so. 

Speaker
OK. 

Aaron
Does carbon really hold heat? I don't know. Maybe we should check again. 

Shawn
Just a few more decades of studies, to be sure, and then we can really get in. We're. 

Hazel
A good faith partner y'all. Just one more study, bro. Please. Just one more study. I no, I promise. 

Speaker 4
Just. 

Hazel
Bro, just one more study. 

Shawn
And then they're also pushing some bizarre economic arguments. One of the bizarre economic arguments was that the market would. Naturally adjusts to climate change that the market is the regulator of human society. And as things become more expensive over here and cheaper over there, while the market with its pluck and magic is going to push us all in the right direction, everything's just going to be hunky Dory. 

Hazel
Hmm. Yeah, I found this very interesting because I was like reading through all of these old environmental economics papers, and they had this assumption that they made kind of at the top all the time, which was the global interconnected economy, is just infinitely flexible. The supply chain can bend to whatever happens. If there's like a crop failure here. Don't worry, we'll just grow crops. Over here, and I feel like that's just such a funny assumption to make now that we've all lived through COVID and the supply chain issues there. Just clearly not a flexible global economy at all. 

Aaron
It's like maybe eventually you'll adapt or like after enough people die that we need less crops, then that's kind of a a type of flexibility in a way, but soldiers on. 

Speaker
The mark. 

Hazel
Just move a couple people around. 

Shawn
Into graves. 

Speaker 2
Earth. 

Hazel
Only I mean, if it's efficient to have some people die, then it's economically efficient, OK. 

Aaron
It's a weird thing with some of these economic arguments. A lot of the time. Is that like, Oh yeah, the market will adapt to the market, but when you ask them, like, what does the market adapting actually look like? They're like, oh, this is companies will go out of business and other ones will come up to take their place and think, OK, But what happens like in between that or what happens all the people who worked for that? Company who went out of business, who now no longer have jobs or this industry no longer exists, or like their entire town is flooded or, well, they can move to another place. OK, well, what about the ones who died in the flood? Like what? You can talk about the market that in this, like, broad sense of like, it will adapt eventually. But like, what about all those inflection points in between? Like what about the things that we have to adapt to? And if those things are like harming people in real physical? Ways sure. Like maybe the market will adapt eventually in some way. People will figure out how to sell **** to each other, and the ones who have enough money will be able to buy it. But that's not actually the point. The point is like the human cost of the process that you're describing happening. 

Shawn
If if one company destroys the world and kills everyone, then the consumers will simply choose another company and the market will reward whoever's not destroying the planet forever and killing everyone. 

Hazel
Haven't you guys heard of a boycott? 

Aaron
So true. 

Hazel
You get it? Yes, three. The moving people around in 1980, a group of economists. This is the Nirenberg committee. Which I believe was made-up of climate scientists and economists. But the economists came to very different conclusions than the scientists. The economists saying that the best they're both, and they're both equally science economists are out there in their science labs doing science, looking at the facts, such as the fact that the most. 

Shawn
Well, they're both equally important groups when it comes to climate change. 

Hazel
Economical response, according to Thomas Schelling, the chair of this committee and prominent economist at Harvard shelling, suggested that the best response to global warming was not to control fossil fuels, but instead arrange mass human migration and adaptation. So that's that's the most economically. 

Shawn
Gotta arrange that. 

Hazel
Yeah. We just got to arrange it. Yeah, well, the market will. No, we don't have to. No, no, no, don't worry. We don't have to do it. The market will do it for us. Yeah. So it's fine. So we. 

Shawn
It's like throwing a party. What night works for you? Oh, even better. Fully automated luxury. 

Hazel
Don't have to do anything actually. Fully automated luxury refugee crises. 

Aaron
Yeah, just yeah. And things that are like way easier to say in a sentence than to actually do just arrange mass migration of people away from the coast. Like, just just do it, just arrange. It's really easy. Like that's like 4 words. Just arrange it, you know, arrange mass migration. 

Hazel
Yeah, it's fine. 

Shawn
Yeah, we should. 

Hazel
That's way that's easier than a tax, at least, because the tax would. Be really expensive. 

Shawn
I've got a short proposal. How about we arrange criminal trials for the people who have destroyed our planet for profit and we seize their assets and redistribute? 

Aaron
Really like. 

Shawn
Towards policies for an ecological transition. 

Aaron
That's like 25 words already. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Aaron
Don't know how much. That was a lot more words than just like. 

Hazel
That's not very efficient from how long it took to explain. OK, OK. No. Yeah, I'm. 

Shawn
No, no market will do it. The market will do it. 

Hazel
On. Board the market will redistribute their assets. 

Shawn
All we have to do is put a price on people's heads. I'm just spitballing to. 

Hazel
Yeah, I think that's called internalizing externalities. 

Shawn
Yeah. Yeah. It's just like a citizens arrest kind of thing. It's like you capture the climate criminals and you bring them to the International court, etcetera. You get a financial. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
Reward. 

Hazel
Wow, supply and demand. 

Speaker
So. 

Aaron
Supply and demand. Now this makes economic sense. Yeah, this. 

Hazel
Now I can make a chart about this. I can make a graph where 2 lines intersect, that means it's. Efficient. 

Shawn
I'd be curious, do you guys think this makes economic sense? I mentioned the Global Climate coalition, so at the same time that they were adjusting their design plans for oil and gas extraction to be ready for climate change. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
And at the same time that they were lobbying politicians against any sort of thing that would change climate change. The Global Climate Coalition, which involved a variety of oil and gas groups coming together on a communication strategy and had a budget in the millions of dollars American per year. And worked through the 1990s. They lobbied politicians, spread messages, for example, climate action will increase your energy bill by 600%. 

Hazel
Hmm. 

Shawn
We can't do anything until China and India do things they pollute too. And simultaneously lobbied for a bill that passed through the United States that said the US would not sign on to any agreement which gave different requirements to the first world and the developing world, and then also lobbied against the agreements. That met that criteria, saying that it wasn't fair to the developing world. 

Hazel
I'd. I'd also like to jump in here and point out you said energy prices would jump up 600%. The price of my energy bill is going to sextuple, I believe. 

Shawn
That's right. 

Hazel
The word so the. 

Shawn
How are you? Gonna get food in your children's mouths. 

Hazel
Well, I guess we can't tax it. I would like to point out that the way that they arrived at this number, see you, you kind of go by a certain set of assumptions when you do economics because you don't actually have a lab in which to do economics. You just have to assume that certain things are true. 

Shawn
Imagination pattern grid worlds. 

Hazel
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, in this case, when the economists were doing real economic science, the assumption that they made that the entire study of your energy bills will go up six times, the assumption that they made was that renewable energy will not be developed as a result like. This policy will not result in the development of new. Clean energies, clean energy solutions. You'll just have to. You'll just have to reduce your energy use and then in a later paper they said that they assumed again a priority, like no evidence to support this. They just made this assumption. 

Aaron
Right. You'll just have to keep buying carbon energies. 

Hazel
At the top. That the cheapest possible clean energy substitute would be four times as expensive in 2100. So solar power would cost four times as much as natural gas in 2100. So like before then it would be even more expensive. So that's those are some, those are some very scientific assumptions that were made. And when you look at the math, it's hard to tell that those are the assumptions they're making. So you go wow those economics boys, sure, we're doing economics and. 

Aaron
Assumptions. They should that math, that math is really math and the two sides of the equation are matching up and must be. 

Hazel
They're economics labs. That really meant that that math. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Those lines are. So those lines are so straight. They're intersex. Thing. 

Aaron
Why didn't we just make the assumption that the market would make renewables super cheap if we just, you know, if we made gas and oil extremely expensive immediately in the 1980s, maybe the renewable market would have immediately accounted for that and made it extremely cheap very quickly. 

Speaker
Oh. 

Hazel
Well, I do. I do have a very scientific and economical reason for this is because these studies were funded by the American Petroleum Institute. 

Aaron
Right. 

Speaker
OK. Hmm. 

Shawn
Supply and demand. 

Hazel
Yeah. Supply and demand. How was that for a reveal? Did we like that? 

Aaron
I not to be rude, but it was kind of kind of obvious, you know. 

Speaker 4
No. 

Hazel
Here I here I was thinking they were doing their economics in a vacuum. 

Aaron
Wasn't quite in. Wasn't quite an M Night Shyamalan level twist. There it was. 

Hazel
Just a bunch of dudes and white lab coats with like a whiteboard. Just making their calculations in a vacuum. 

Shawn
It's easy to criticize from the sidelines there, and I'd like to hear your big twists. 

Aaron
No, that's true. That's right. I don't have one. I don't, I'm. 

Shawn
Sorry, so the global climate coalition across the 1990s, they're key messages were #1. The science isn't definitive enough to take drastic action, at least not publicly. We can privately take drastic action to protect our investments, of course, and #2. Action on climate change should be evaluated primarily in terms of its economic impact. In an undated brag sheet from the GCC in the late 1990s, they made a number of claims about how wonderful their program went across the 90s, and it makes sense when you think about how people used to talk about climate change when you were like, young and stuff. It's like these pieces of **** ******* pulled it off and God bless them for it. And I'd hire them for a project in a minute. But. 

Speaker
Brexit. 

Aaron
What do you mean global warming? It's snowing out. 

Shawn
The GCC has effectively turned the tide on media coverage of climate GCC actively influenced the debate on carbon taxes, emphasizing the economic damages, and GCC responded to every new scientific finding and international policy announcement, often being quoted in those very articles. So the GCC effectively, and there's a number of groups, including the Global Climate Council. The American Petroleum industry Environmental Conservation Association, Americans for Prosperity and the Heartland Institute look up all those individually. 

Hazel
I love Americans for prosperity. As a name. *** ****, they weren't even trying. 

Shawn
Uh. Americans against prosperity. 

Hazel
Yeah. Yeah. It's like there's a dartboard. And they were just flinging darts. Americans for prosperity? Sure. 

Shawn
They turned the unambiguous so you could argue that there was uncertainties across the 1950s and 60s. It was pretty clear there was a lot of evidence even in the 50s and 60s for this. But in the 70s it became rock solid. Climate change is caused by CO2 from fossil fuels, rock solid in the 19. 70s they were already working according to these assumptions in their own internal documents, but following the big public discourse around climate change in the late 1980s across the 1990s, successfully, these lobbying groups, funded by the oil and gas industry, to the tune of millions of dollars, successfully turned media coverage of climate change. And just sort of, he said. She said kind of thing of on one hand, we have these concerned scientists. On the other hand, we have these not. Scientists, asterisks paid by the oil and gas industry, funded directly by oil and gas. Money. 

Hazel
What is that? Trump quote, it's like both very good people, both sides, very good. People on both sides. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Hazel
Very fine people on both sides. I don't know, misquoting very fine people on both sides, I'm sure. 

Shawn
And in the early 1990s, when the Clinton administration was working on some sort of moderate energy pricing deal, the oil and gas industry responded by aggressively threatening all Democratic senators up for reelection with primarying campaigns and with funding their opponents until they backed down off of it then instead advancing. A voluntary program. So I think their original plan was like to reduce. To 1990 levels by 2000, something like that. And then they switched to a voluntary plan and then eventually they reeled that back to because the oil and assets. 

Aaron
Is a bit too intense a voluntary plan. 

Hazel
So I'm supposed to do something hmm. 

Shawn
So as a whole, when you look at the oil and gas industry as a kind of self interested socioeconomic Organism, what it was doing was knowingly preparing for a future where the world would be destroyed as a result of their actions and actively preventing any sort of action that would prevent that future. Now to me. Me. That sounds like a murderer trying to murder everyone. Like, and I'm like. 

Aaron
While also hiding their tracks kind of, or at least like trying to prevent themselves from getting any accountability for the murder. 

Shawn
Yeah. And there was this internal document from 1998 where they even said we may in the future be subjected to class action lawsuits because we're doing all of this. Yes, which they now are and they. 

Hazel
So this is like 40 years later. So at this point, everybody's gotten their bonuses. So who cares? 

Shawn
Should be more. 

Aaron
With the class action lawsuit, it's like CEO bonuses. I already got my. 

Hazel
I'm not part of the company. 

Shawn
Golden yeah. 

Hazel
Hold on, parachute. Jinx. 

Shawn
Yeah, my children have their bunker. But no, I think I mean this is this is uh. This is a big ******* deal. I think this is actually the biggest story of politics of our lives, and it's hard to summarize every aspect of this, but the more that I've read about it and the more that I've thought about it, I've been like, I'm not sure that very many things matter as much as this. It's like we had a rogue industry of. Our society that for over. 50 years actively attempted murder actually attempted to murder all of us for money. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Shawn
It's it's worse than the. 

Aaron
A. Yeah, I was just gonna bring up the tobacco thing, cause it's kind of like that. But instead of, like, causing cancer. I don't know. This is it's. It's a bit more localized when it's just like, oh, if you smoke. Will get cancer if people around you were smoking, you know, slightly higher chance of getting cancer. But this is more like it's like, you know, on a global scale. It's the whole planet. It's the climate of the planet. It's the atmosphere of the planet. It's the coastlines, agriculture. They're just everything. The planet, you know, the biosphere of the planet that we all live on. It's like, yeah, just, like, kind of the same thing as the tobacco thing, but on a much broader scale in a way that affects literally everybody. 

Hazel
But. But if I smoke here in Vancouver, someone in like West Africa dies or something. Yeah, if I if. Oh, I'll, I'll. I'll credit the tweet. I saw this in a tweet where it's like, you know, that, you know, that little conundrum of you press the button and you get $1,000,000 but someone you don't know somewhere dies. The oil industry just slammed that button over and over again for millions of years. Was this your tweet? This seems like something you would tweet. 

Shawn
It wasn't, but it's. 

Aaron
True, it's a good tweet. Wish wish you could take credit for it. 

Hazel
It's a good tweet, guys. Sorry it was a. 

Aaron
Yeah, I was a a post a post. 

Shawn
We now go to three people being repeatedly stabbed. 

Speaker 2
Ah. Sure. 

Speaker
No. 

Aaron
Stop stabbing you guys. This person is stabbing us to death. He's killing us. He's murdering. 

Shawn
Us. That's one theory about what's happening. 

Aaron
I mean, it's pretty obvious like if you just. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Hazel
Look, maybe you're getting jabbed air quotes, but like, how do you know it's murder if you're not already dead? 

Aaron
Well, I mean, that's kind of what's going to happen. Like it's pretty obvious to be easy to predict. 

Shawn
Well, I mean, if we stop someone getting like, we can't stop people from getting stabbed over here until we stop people from getting stabbed over in China and India. Yeah. You know, it's a collective action problem. 

Aaron
Well, I guess, but it's happening right now. 

Hazel
Actually, like the crime rate here is pretty low compared to like how other places where there's a lot more stabbing. 

Shawn
Yeah, really low. 3 low crime rate, so it's very unlikely we're being stabbed. Actually I don't. 

Hazel
If you if you take a look at this graph I made, it is showing that we are just fine. It's showing me sleeping tight in my bed and that's what I choose to be. 

Aaron
Know. I just feel like we don't have time to to debate about this. We gotta do something now. But quickly before we're, like, bleed out. You know, it feels like it's kind of urgent and we're dying. 

Speaker 4
All right. 

Shawn
So if we're going to accuse someone of stabbing, we need to be absolutely sure this is something we should have caution about because it's a libelous to call someone a stabber. 

Aaron
It just. 

Hazel
Dude, we could ruin this guy's life if we accuse him of being a murderer when he hasn't. Even killed any. 

Aaron
Of us look at this note I just pulled out of his pocket. It says I am. I'm going to stab people to death today. My plan is murder. I've been planning this for months and years. 

Speaker
We got. 

Hazel
Find out. 

Aaron
Signed me. 

Shawn
We've gotta we gotta find out the Liberals who faked that note. 

Hazel
We shouldn't we wait and make sure that he goes through with it? I write **** all the. Time it doesn't mean it's true. 

Shawn
We should do a handwriting analysis to be absolutely sure this is the. 

Aaron
Guy, why would he be holding OK? 

Speaker 4
I'm. Hey. Hey, guy out. Hey, whoa, hey, that's my face. 

Hazel
Hey. Hey, guy. 

Shawn
Go ahead. 

Hazel
What is your handwriting like? Do you do? Little loopy loops on. 

Shawn
The eyes? No. What I think from you this is just like a power grab to you. It's like you want to control us. Do you think like you're trying to? 

Aaron
I really just want to stop being stabbed. 

Hazel
Are you running out of blood, Kyle? You don't got. Enough blood, I mean. Yeah, I'm doing just fight over here. 

Aaron
I don't think that's true. I don't think you. Are. All of our shirts are completely soaked with our blood. There's blood pooling on the ground. It's hard to even tell how much blood came from you and me and him, but there's too much. I'm just telling you it's. Too. 

Shawn
Much blood. Hey, are are you stabbing us right now? I think we need to launch an investigation, we need to have a process. 

Hazel
For this, yeah, it have. You never heard of innocent until proven guilty. 

Shawn
And if he is stabbing us, let's say he was, it might be bad for the economy to stop him. If someone is paying him for it, that's increasing GDP. 

Speaker
Staff. 

Hazel
I mean, I know I'm unemployed and I'm not contributing anything anyway. 

Aaron
Alright guys, I'm starting to get pretty lightheaded here, so I don't think I can argue anymore. 

Hazel
Went. 

Shawn
Stopping the stabbing might increase our bills. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, this guy's wearing, like, a suit. He looks. He looks pretty important. He probably knows better than us. 

Shawn
And hopefully. If we assume that being stabbed will not increase our shirt costs, but stopping stabbing will increase our shirts cost by 600%. 

Aaron
Why would we assume that that doesn't make any sense? 

Shawn
They could really harm our wardrobe budget. 

Speaker 4
Can you can you reach into my pocket and get my pocket calculator? I got some numbers to run. 

Shawn
Two, I'm two weeks. I'm too weak because of the Liberals. Been feeding me so. 

Speaker 4
I'm too weak because of woke, but not because of anybody stabbing me. That's not. That's not why it's cause. 

Speaker
Protect. 

Shawn
This innocent meant my last thought is protect this innocent man at all costs. From what the Liberals are trying to do to him. 

Speaker 4
Protect. 

Shawn
The economy and that was three people being repeatedly stabbed. And now back to our show. 

Aaron

And advertising is a form of mind poison and at Sweet Six will also get you access to our bonus episodes at Discord Server, and you also get our episodes. Before anyone else, your contribution will help keep seriously wrong going for 1000 episodes. That's what. 

Aaron
That's what the projections say that after 1000 episodes, I don't want to make any promises, but maybe maybe I will. Maybe I'll just make the promise that if we hit 1000 episodes there. 

Shawn
Yeah. 

Aaron
Will be 10,000 years of World Peace. 

Shawn
That's just objectively factual. That's like talking to a doctor. Like, that's what a high level of epistemology we're dealing with. 

Aaron
And that's a promise, that's a guarantee. Yeah. What was that thing you mentioned? What was it? Americans for Prosperity or something? They love creating these little groups. They I found this thing. It's a the western States Petroleum Association. 

Hazel
Americans for prosperity. 

Aaron
And as a Consulting Group, I believe there was a leaked PowerPoint slide from them in 2014 where they were bragging. I guess you could say about all the different organizations that they've created that are just subsidiaries of them, that they, you know, you wouldn't publicly say that they're all created from the same thing. We want this to seem like it's a bunch of independent groups. All pushing for the stuff we need, but yeah, it's this leaked PowerPoint presentation where they're like, yeah, no way. Behind Californians for energy independence, fed up at the pump, save our jobs tank, the tax fueling California Oregonians for sound fuel policy. Who's? 

Hazel
I think they should workshop tank attacks policy. 

Aaron
And against sound fuel policy. Take the tax. I think. I think that one it's slaps. It's yeah. Well, yeah, that's true. 

Hazel
It should rhyme, I think. What if it was like Axe, axe, the tax? 

Aaron
It has not rhyming. What's the other one? Alliteration tank the tag like the two Tees. That's kind of punchy. Mental hydraulic fracturing campaign. 

Speaker 4
I'm just looking for. 

Aaron
Is actually not, not one of the best, but yeah, there's like, I don't know, 20 or 15 orgs on there. And then the little side text, it says in 2014, WSPA has activated a significant number of campaigns and coalition. So these were all activated in 2014 and they're, you know. 

Speaker 4
Come on. 

Aaron
Still around to this day, activating more of these campaigns. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Hazel
And what these do? Like what these all of these grassroots or I guess you could call them Astroturf campaigns kind of lead to is what appears to be real grassroots action. Is this something you see on Facebook a lot? Actually, is these Facebook groups with full of real people who show up to City Council meetings to like, protest solar power or whatever, and where where my mom lives in Nebraska, she noticed like all of a sudden all these people showing up to protest wind power. And then of course, you look into it for 5 minutes and it comes from a think tank that got millions of dollars of funding that just showed up in Nebraska. But now it's a grassroots effort. 

Aaron
Yeah, funding people that show up at town meetings and stuff. Yeah, that's like. Powerful. Powerful. Yeah, we could do that. 

Shawn
You just said a few million here. 

Aaron
And there house everyone like across the entire country. 

Hazel
It's it's a little bit kind of hope core in a way that they're spending all of this money on these small, like local campaigns, because it really shows that local action is the most effective thing, right. But it's also a huge bummer. 

Shawn
Yeah. One thing about that too that I always think of for like the people who are joining these these front groups and you know. These these. Yeah, these concerned mineral mineral owners of California and so on these concerned people who are fed up at the pump etcetera. And you know like on one level it's hard not to feel bad for these simpletons because, I mean, this is one of the tucked up things about this, this whole like, disinformation, misinformation. 

Aaron
Concerned mineral owners of California. 

Shawn
You know, fear, uncertainty, doubt, ********. Over the last couple of decades is like when you go to Thanksgiving dinner and you have your extended relatives there. There's like. This spike through the table like there's this some people don't live in reality anymore because people have paid millions of dollars to remove them from reality. So like an extreme version of that is like your Q Anon type stuff. But even just at like the basic level of whether or not climate change is real, whether or not oil and gas causes climate change and etcetera. And like what sort of actions need to be taken to make an ecological transition away from a society that poses an existential threat to us and our children, their children's children, and for not having kids, our neighbors, etcetera. You should still care about kids that aren't. Course, as James Baldwin said, all the children of the world are all of ours. 

Aaron
Yeah. When you say our children, you mean our collective children as a society. 

Shawn
Exactly. But when they grow up, **** them. 

Hazel
The kids. 

Shawn
Just wondering, so sweet little dog. 

Aaron
Then you said caring about their children. 

Shawn
So there's this like social. Not only now, I think probably primarily the global warming, the loss of biodiversity, the shooting through all of our environmental boundaries and so on. That's probably the main thing, but a little thing that really bugs me that I really, really don't like. And actually for real it makes me angry, is that there's people who've paid millions of millions of dollars to deceive our neighbors, our family members, people that we should be in community with, that we should be able to talk to, and they rob us of the ability to connect with them. And they rob us of the ability to talk about our shared situation because we face existential threats from this sort of stuff. And like the fact that you can't go to your neighbor and trust that you have a shared baseline of being able to talk about what science is, what energy is, you know, etcetera, is a result. They spent millions of dollars to drive those social wedges. Between us and like, yeah, it's so not ******* wholesome. These are people that we should be able to talk to as human beings, a human being, and have a shared basis of like. Exploring the information together and being able to come to conclusions, but these people are polarized against the idea of of of even considering alternatives because of a multimillion, probably billions, billions of dollars have been spent over decades to turn them into misled simpleton pawns of evil profiteering *****. Who are trying to kill us all and kill the children of the world? And like, that's hardly an exaggeration. And that social thing, the more that I've meditated on that, the more I've had genuine ******* anger for these pieces of **** because they've robbed something of so fundamental from us, which is like human life. They've robbed us of human life and. The world is ****** from what they're doing in a variety of ways. But the fact that they've taken ******* human like social life from us, and they've tainted it with their it's it's oil. With their ******* lies. 

Hazel
Yeah, like you can't. You can't have a relationship with somebody, even just a friendship. If it's like we're not that if you don't agree that the climate change is real, it's hard to talk to you. And that shouldn't be a baseline for making friends, right. 

Shawn
Yeah, well, but if if you can't, if you can't like, and you could be friends and like never bring it up and we go camping together or. 

Hazel
But it but it kind of is. 

Shawn
Whatever. But like. There's still something missing there that's so fundamental in human about understanding when you. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, it's rough. 

Shawn
Both when someone's trying to kill both of you and you look in the eyes and you say someone's trying to kill us and they're like, no, actually **** you for saying that. Like what a what a brutal sick thing they've done to our world. Like, that's really something to that. And I just really want to like, how sick is that? 

Speaker 2
Umm. 

Shawn
And we're talking about decades. This is socially criminal on a way that it's like hard to overstate is that they've taken something from us that's so fundamental. Our ability to relate to one. Another and they've put a wedge through our society that will probably take decades or hundreds of years to fix just as severe as the ecological crisis that we face from their actions. And why did they do it? Because they wanted to be ******* rich, and they were willing to do. Anything. To make that happen, they were willing to do the most criminal and horrific. Fit imaginable to do that. 

Hazel
And this isn't even like a do you believe in climate change? Do you not believe in climate change split? This is. Like the general wedging apart of peoples opinions and the splintering of society has kind of come from funding all of these, like super neoliberal think tanks that pull ideologies so far apart that like there's just two separate parts of the Overton window that don't talk. 

Aaron
Anymore. Yeah, it happens in climate change and neoliberal it also has. Happens in to various extents on like conspiracy movements, anti COVID stuff. The election was stolen in the US 2020 like it keeps happening over and over again. 

Hazel
Yeah. So a lot of that you can track, you can track a lot of that rhetoric, even the non climate stuff back to. Well, my. 

Aaron
Various like think tanks or. Yeah, yeah, it's. It's the same people. Even if it's not an oil specific think tank. It was funded by the same billionaires. It was some other think tank funded by them. 

Hazel
Folk brothers. 

Speaker 4
So on. 

Hazel
Yeah, I will say that the social damage did not hit me until I heard you talking about it. And then I got really mad. So here to say anger. Fasting works. 

Shawn
Yeah, it's so ******, man. It's so. 

Aaron
No, I mean. ****** like I'm from Alberta, which is like Canada oil, oil, country. So I know a lot of people's Medicine Hat. Yeah. OK. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of oil people in Edmonton. I lived there for a few years. Yeah. 

Speaker
Where are you from? 

Hazel
OK, I'm sorry. 

Aaron
So yeah, I know a lot of people who like have made their living on the oil industry. And like, you know, you don't necessarily bring up climate change or like, talk about it just like the way they'll talk about climate activists or climate politicians talking about climate things. It's just very clear that it's all like. Seen as this cynical power grab like Ohh, Trudeau is trying to grab power and tax the companies in order to blah blah blah. I don't even know how to. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
It's not my beloved oil barons. 

Aaron
Summarize the. But it's seen as like an attack on them because they work for these oil companies like, oh, they're trying to put us out of business. They're trying to hurt me and my family. And it's like in one sense, like sure, like, yeah, I think, you know, Trudeau or whoever else you want to talk about, liberal politicians are mostly cynical about it. The things they're proposing. Don't go far, and I won't actually fix the problems. Like even if we'd implemented carbon tax like more thoroughly, or made it higher or made less loopholes in it, that wouldn't necessarily have solved the problem. But like yeah, it's just. I've mostly just given up like trying to have conversations about these kinds of things with, like people in my extended family or when not. 

Speaker
And. 

Aaron
Who? Work for or are connected to, or whatever, or. However, this is related to it because it's just like. Yeah, like you're saying it's socially destructive, but at the same time it's like. 

Hazel
Just sad. Yeah. Well, there there is lots of. And also I can give anecdotal evidence, but there is some evidence to suggest that most of the folks who work, you know, for oil companies and the oil fields and. And such would jump at the idea of of a job that's similarly well paying that just happens to be clean energy. So like the just transition would include them. And I I don't think I I think most of them would be fine with that. I'm sure there would be some people who are like, no, I only want to work for the oil company, but mainly what people like isn't oil. 

Aaron
Oh yeah. No, totally. 

Hazel
What people like isn't their job. What people like is having money to pay for their families. 

Aaron
Yeah, it's the paycheck. Yeah, exactly. 

Hazel
So yeah, and. 

Shawn
Gingrich is probably awesome. 

Hazel
And it feels like we're threatening that. What's that? 

Shawn
I said being rich is probably awesome. 

Aaron
Yeah, it's not. And people I'm thinking aren't even rich. They just like, you know, have a decent job, a decent salary or whatever. But. 

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just talking about. Like people who work in Fort McMurray, you. 

Shawn
Know, right? Yeah, exactly. They make pretty good. Money there, if they do. 

Hazel
They do. 

Aaron
They make good money. 

Hazel
But it's like short. Term. Yeah, you can't stay there. 

Aaron
It's like you'll you'll be on for two weeks, and if you look at the amount of money they made in two weeks, you're like, oh, wow. But then they're off for three weeks and like, it's still pretty good money. They'll have big trucks. They're all like, buying houses and stuff, like, not trying to say it's bad overall, but it's. Yeah. Weird. 

Hazel
Yeah. Anyway, Alberta moment. 

Shawn
Yeah, here's an interesting fact. George HW Bush during the campaign trail promised to tackle global warming because it was a major issue at the time, but his administration backed off after a crank oil industry aligned. Scientists pitched them on his theory that global warming is actually caused by the sun and not. CO2. His study was disproven by the IPCC, but his influence remained in that government and future Republican governments. 

Aaron
I remember hearing that probably like 10 years ago, the last time I was really listening to like, climate deniers. But yeah, just like in natural cycles of the sun, sometimes the sun gets hotter, sometimes it gets cooler. And so yeah, if we're, like, the temperatures raised in the last few years, it's just because of the. I've definitely heard that one. 

Hazel
Solar flares, natural changes in the environment. 

Aaron
Who can really say that it wasn't the sun, so I don't have a crystal ball to predict the future, do you? 

Hazel
Who can say? Certainly not scientists. Are you a scientist? I'm not a scientist. Are all the scientists who told us what the truth is? Scientists. I don't think so. 

Aaron
We now go to a coincidence theorist talking about climate change. 

Shawn
2023 was the hottest year on record around the world in terms of global temperatures, but who cares? It's just a coincidence. I mean, it's just a coincidence that the world has been steadily warming since the 1870s. It's it's just a coincidence. It's a coincidence the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing. Just a coincidence that the ice caps have been steadily increasing. Shrinking it's a coincidence that the oil and gas industry was aware of this as early as the 1950s and in their internal speeches and internal documents from the 1960s, seventies repeatedly say that climate change is caused by CO2 emissions from their products. You know, oil and gas. I mean, that's just a coincidence. It's just a weird. Coincidence. And it's just a coincidence the fossil fuel industry spawned a complex web of public relations and disinformation strategies which attempted to obscure their participation in climate change and funded disinformation operations of lobbying to mislead the public, spending billions making politicians around the world halt to action against carbon emissions. It's just a coincidence. I mean, the models that they had internally. Have proven to be extremely accurate over time in terms of making connections between the CO2 and the atmosphere and global warming. These are all just funny weird. Coincidence is because life is like that. Sometimes. Sometimes life just has funny little coincidences and it's just nothing to worry about. Who cares? Grow up. Grow up. You're you're being. You're being crazy. Honestly, you're being ******* crazy right now. It's just a coincidence, OK? It's normal. And that's just one of those weird little things. 

Aaron
And that was a coincidence. Theorist on climate change. 

Shawn
One thing I forgot to mention about the wonderful year of 1989 was this wording always stuck out to me and I was like, I was like trying to find us. I couldn't remember the exact wording, but there was just something so striking about it was that there's this internal document planning scenarios document made by shell which compared two scenarios, the sustainable world scenario. 

Hazel
My favorite year? 

Shawn
Where efforts are made to switch to sustainable energy and to curb CO2 emissions, and the alternative, which they called global mercantilism. Which always raised to me the vibe of like Mad Max. No, I was trying to figure out what they even meant by mercantilism. So mercantilism is like an archaic economic order where there's like a 0 sum economic thinking where one person's gain is another person's loss. There's also the era of colonialism was like the mercantilist. Era. 

Hazel
Countries act is kind of monopolies. 

Shawn
Yeah. So I imagine that they meant it as and we've only got a fraction of this document, but I imagine that they meant it as almost sort of like a regression from free market capitalism towards a more protectionist form of capitalism, right? Because they're they're all like, good patriotic capitalists who support the free market. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
And they're like, if we continue on this path, capitalism is going to regress to a pre capitalist 0 sum colonialist kind of system. But it looks like we're on the road to global mercantilism. Is the take away of this? I just it always it always really just sounded like Mad Max to me, global mercantilism. 

Aaron
And it also sounds like I don't know when you're comparing those two things. One of them just obviously sounds better like sustainable. 

Shawn
Sustainable worlds. World life to avoid this at all cost, gentlemen. 

Aaron
Because when you said that, I was thinking the other side of it was gonna be like prosperity or like something like really great, you know, like, cause how you gonna make sustainable world sound bad? 

Speaker 4
Well, I mean. 

Hazel
Maybe global mercantilism could mean like, again, this is the thing that Adam Smith was like saying was bad, was not like government control over the economy so much as the government acting as the entire economy. 

Shawn
Yeah, what's interpreted as like corporations as government is like, where my mind goes when I read that. 

Hazel
Yes. Yeah. Or or governments as corporations like there there are certainly are like governments that mainly act as like oil companies or at least partially act as oil companies. For example, Canada nailed it. 

Shawn
For example Canada. 

Hazel
The secret Petro state you never knew to look for. 

Shawn
So in their machinations, they funded this economic ********. These economic lies, and they funded economists to claim that it was going to drive up the cost for everyone, and they used some weird assumptions to do that. Do you have more that you want to say? 

Hazel
Do I have more assumptions? Ohh I got I got assumptions I didn't realize I was. I was looking at my notes being like, let me tell. 

Shawn
What? What kind of assumptions would they use on that sort? I would be I'd be. I'd be. I'd be curious as I know that you cover economics on your TikTok and YouTube channel and. 

Hazel
You. 

Speaker 2
OK. 

Speaker
A legend. 

Shawn
Instagram. 

Hazel
Yes. Yeah, yeah. So first of all, we went over the, I have them numbered as wild assumptions one through 8 #1 wild assumption being that the API American Petroleum Institutes report on energy prices would go up by 6 * 600% under the assumptions that alternatives to fossil fuels basically wouldn't exist later on further API. Funded economists would say, yeah, sure they do exist, but they would be four times as expensive for the rest of our lives. Again. Crazy. 

Aaron
Yeah, they already cheaper or like. 

Hazel
They are already cheaper and even when this came out, like nuclear energy, which isn't renewable, but it is like 0 or at least near 0 emission existed. So what a crazy assumption to make. And the second assumption would be that even if we did put some kind of a price on emissions. That would not spur any kind of innovation in clean technology. So this is called in economics induced technological change and they just sort of assumed that that would not happen if we made fossil fuels more expensive, people would just use less energy and energy would cost more. 

Aaron
Isn't that like the exact opposite of like? 

Shawn
The economic argument. 

Speaker 4
How works? 

Aaron
Economics like they're they're normal assumptions that economics always if something gets more expensive, then alternatives to that thing start getting cheaper, like even that just. 

Shawn
That's what you say in the newspaper. That's not what you say in your economics report. 

Hazel
That's what you say when you're not getting paid by the people whose product you. Keep using. Yeah. Yeah. It's called supply and demand, Aaron. Now, the following assumptions were made by Charles River Associates who were completely funded by the petroleum industry, Charles River and Associates ignored any of the costs of climate change. And a lot of their reports. So like. 

Aaron
Right. Makes so much sense. 

Hazel
Later on you would get these neoclassical economists being like, oh, actually, no. Climate change will cost us money. Not a lot, but maybe some. But in these there's not a whole lot of assumptions that climate change are is going to cost any. Money. Meanwhile, if we reduce pollution, they also ignored any of the monetary or just like regular, like living benefits of reducing pollution, they ignored any benefits to health or living standards or anything from the reduction of pollution. None of that made the cut. The only thing that made the cut was the idea that energy is going to be more expensive. 

Aaron
So if we assume that reducing pollution won't help anyone or anything, and we, what was the other one we assume? 

Hazel
And we assume that climate change is not going to cost us any to much money. 

Aaron
Right, we assume. 

Shawn
And we assume that alternatives to oil are not possible are not going to happen and. 

Hazel
Not. 

Aaron
Or if they do happen, they'll be way more expensive. 

Hazel
Really. You simply can't do it. 

Aaron
Ohh yeah, if we just make a few of those assumptions, it seems like oil that's a great that's a great. 

Hazel
Thing. Well, yeah. I mean, all of these assumptions came from the economics guide from above. And so we don't have to actually use any evidence to support our assumptions. We have to use this as evidence to make our little graphs that make. 

Aaron
We should pull more out. Burn it. 

Hazel
Oil looks so good. 

Shawn
I've got some assumptions to pitch. 

Speaker
Oh. 

Shawn
What if we assume that the people who did this to our planet have names and addresses? What if we assume that a global order that we participate in might be capable of holding people criminally liable for the attempted murder of human civilization? 

Hazel
Let's say hypothetically we had an International Criminal Court, possibly in the Netherlands. 

Aaron
I I don't know how to make these work on. 

Hazel
The graph I'm not seeing this in my equation man. 

Aaron
If I don't my the lines not going straight, it's the the equation is not balancing left. Yeah, not assume this. 

Hazel
Price is. Equaling quantity guys. 

Shawn
I'm going back to economics 101, sorry. I was being ******* stupid. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crack open a textbook. 

Hazel
So continuing our our wild assumptions, once we graduated from having Charles River Associates or I guess this sort of happened at. The same time. 

Shawn
We have kind of an earlier it goes back and forth on whether the oil and gas industry is like this is all fake and lame and not true versus being like we're a good faith partner. We totally agree. We're just trying to figure it out. Gee, Willikers going back and forth, there's like different strains at different times of and like now obviously. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. And they. Said they seem to be happening at the same time. A lot of the times where it's like, oh. It's real and we're trying, but also it's not real. We're funding dark money groups that. 

Shawn
Are saying it's fake and making your grandma insane, yeah. 

Hazel
Not my grandma. 

Shawn
She won't hug you anymore. 

Hazel
She my my grandma Full disclosure does not like me because I'm a vegetarian. So yeah, we're we're out here, man. OK. Yeah. So. So this is less like directly funded by fossil fuel money. This is more just like I'm an economist and I use numbers to make things make sense. So. 

Shawn
Which is bad enough by itself. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. How dare you? So my arch nemesis, William Nordhaus and his colleagues asserted that because 87% of the economy is in quote, carefully controlled environment. Only 13% of the economy can possibly be affected by climate change. Now what he means by carefully controlled environments is inside indoors, only 3% of the US economy is very considered very climate sensitive, which is agriculture. So. 

Speaker 4
Hmm. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Aaron
Endorsing. Like I understand that like office buildings are indoors. But don't you have to go outdoors in order to travel between your house and the office building? 

Hazel
Well, no, you can just telecommute. Or if there's a if there's a hurricane outside, I'm just going to. 

Aaron
Yeah, I guess like we could do. All of them. Like that. 

Hazel
Zoom into my meeting, right? 

Shawn
The pneumatic tubes. 

Hazel
Yes. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. 

Aaron
Yeah, if we if we cover all the streets with tubes and make them all indoor streets, kind of, I guess. But that's I assume they weren't making the assumption that we'd have to. 

Hazel
Pay for that? Yeah. No, because that's a lot of investment in infrastructure and that's not very economically sound. 

Aaron
Because just when I think about what percent of the economy involves outdoors or non carefully controlled environments, I would say like kind of all of it like the shipping like trucks and ships go outdoors when. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. Yeah, yeah. 

Hazel
Shipping, mining for resources. Agriculture for. 

Aaron
They might be reminding. Yeah, like the order of like. 

Shawn
Like indoors is inside outdoors, right? 

Aaron
100% of it. Yeah, the. 

Shawn
Like it's nested within. 

Aaron
This building. 

Hazel
The inside is inside the outside. Somebody tell William Nordhaus I'm calling him up. William. 

Aaron
The building. 

Hazel
That's the bad news. 

Aaron
And like carefully controlling the climate inside the buildings, takes variable amounts of energy depending on the conditions outside. Like you know, in Vancouver, when we had a major heat wave a few years ago and a bunch of people died, that's partially because the outside. Even though the people a lot of them who died were inside, the temperature outside changed so much. That it actually affected what was inside, so there's like there's kind of permeable barriers, a lot of the times between what's outside and what's inside. You know, there's windows, there's doors, air conditioners can break, and then the heat will actually just move through the walls to inside and affect people who are inside. So just like. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Hazel
So you're saying the outside can affect the inside? 

Aaron
I don't know about this assumption I am. I. 

Shawn
Sounds like you don't believe in the inextricable thriving of the human spirit, Aaron. 

Aaron
No. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Shawn
You don't think we? 

Aaron
I. Can adapt. We should, but again, like that inflection point, how many people are gonna die in the adaptation phase? That's kind of what? I'm worried about. 

Shawn
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is that people are already dying, but go on. 

Hazel
To quote, yeah, I'd like to read some tweets, if I may. This is a tweet from Richard Toll. Now, Richard Toll is a professor of economics. At the Reese University of Amsterdam in the University of Amsterdam, he's a professor of economics of climate change. Amsterdam got close enough to The Hague, so that's pretty convenient for us now anyway. So Richard Richard Toll has a tweet here. Reading 10°C, he says K is less than the temperature distance between Alaska and Maryland. About equally rich or between Iowa and Florida about equally rich climate is not a primary driver of income. And then someone says, are you actually suggesting a 10°C rise in global average surface temperature would be? Printable Richard Toll says we'd move indoors, much like the Saudis have. So that is, Richard told Professor of Economics and the Economics of Climate change. 

Shawn
Because our main concern about climate change is, of course, that we won't be able to have as much prosperity, it's not that people will die. We'll lose. Biodiversity will not have a stable climate, we'll have catastrophic climate events, will melt the ice caps. 

Aaron
I mean also like hot take. I like outdoors. Like I like being able to go outdoors. That's kind of nice sometimes. 

Hazel
I don't even like the outdoors that much. People are like, why are you an environmentalist? You always are just inside and. I'm like, well, I. Wanna you know people to be able to. Eat, yeah. 

Shawn
Inside is inside the outside. 

Hazel
Inside is inside the outside. Can we call that? Can we call that? The episode that that's really? Good. Yeah and. This actually leads me to my my final wild assumption. If you guys don't. 

Shawn
Well, that guy should go to jail, but continue. 

Hazel
Mind. Uh, that guy? Well, he's right next to the hags, but don't worry gang. 

Aaron
Oh yeah, it would be an easy commute, for he wouldn't have to spend much time outdoors. On the way, which is perfect. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Shawn
For the world that we're creating or that he is creating and we're watching him create. 

Hazel
So the the final wild assumption that I'd like to talk about is in a lot of these papers. They sort of judge the effect that global warming is going to have on the economy by the temperature differentials in places that already exist. So the the example that I would use now they they use fancier math than this, but like to dumb it down, the example I would use is like Edmonton is X degrees colder than Los Angeles, but people in Edmonton and people in Los Angeles are about as prosperous. The GDP per capita. Between Edmonton and LA is not that different. So let's say Edmonton warms up to be the temperature of LA. Edmonton will be fine and that is the sort of logic that they use when assessing the economic damages caused by an X degree. You know a two degree. Increase in global average surface temperatures. It's like, OK, well, how much more prosperous is Edmonton than LA? OK, plug that into the formula. Great. It's going to cost like 2% of GDP, tops. That is, that is the the yeah. So they're using, they're just using places that are hotter than other places to show. 

Aaron
I just. Did you ever notice that like Edmonton isn't on a coast? And if the sea levels rise, it won't be underwater like. 

Hazel
That it's. 

Speaker
Not going to be like that. 

Aaron
You can't directly compare these two. 

Speaker 2
No. Yeah, that's. 

Hazel
I think sometimes they put those in the in the in the studies, but sometimes crucially they don't. And that's funny. 

Shawn
What's the what's the agricultural output of Edmonton when compared to Florida or California? Like, do they reflect that in their? 

Hazel
Ohh see. But agriculture is only 3% of GDP, so we don't. Have to worry about that, right? Yeah. 

Shawn
Ohh thank God I was worried it would four percent, 5%. Then I'd start to sweat but. 

Aaron
Yeah. Look, even if you eliminate all agriculture, you still have 97% of GDP is fine. 

Shawn
97%. I have got to say I don't actually believe these guys are that ******* stupid. I think they know that they're lying. And I think that we need to consider holding them criminally responsible and seizing their assets. But I digress. 

Speaker
Think. 

Hazel
William Nordhouse is still alive. He's 82, but he's still alive, so I just thought. Everybody should know that because I checked beforehand, I was like. I'd like to talk to this guy. 

Shawn
I'd like to have me a couple of guys come over there and crack knuckles and talk to. 

Hazel
This guy? Yeah, I'd like to have a conversation. I want to mention that all of these crazy assumptions that economists make that seem utterly ridiculous to us if we read them out loud without any of. The math, it's not just sort of things that happen in academic settings. These are presented to Congress to prevent things like them joining the Kyoto Protocol or the Kyoto Treaty preventing many, many a carbon tax and a CAP and trade from being passed in the US. Really anytime legislation against the fossil fuel industry is brought up in the US Congress. Somebody will read a report from the Charles River Associates saying that this is terrible, terrible, terrible for the economy and it doesn't pass their findings again, funded by the American Petroleum Institute, have become common knowledge, so much so that I was taught some of it in university, and then I find out where it's from and it's like, oh, that's rough. 

Aaron
We now go to three frogs in a slowly boiling pot of water. 

Shawn
Hey guys. Good to see you. 

Aaron
Hey, good to see you. 

Shawn
How? 

Hazel
Been good. I've been good. Enjoying this weather, eh? 

Aaron
Ohh yeah, it's beautiful. 

Shawn
These summer days I love it. 

Aaron
How are the kids doing the tadpoles? 

Shawn
Ohh, they're the women. 

Hazel
Little tadpoles look at them over there playing together. 

Aaron
So cute, so cute. They're the future. Yeah. Yeah, you said it. I'm constantly inspired. 

Shawn
So inspiring. 

Hazel
It's just so important that we make sure that they're educated and brought up. Right, you know. 

Shawn
And the economy you got to protect the economy for them, obviously keep the GDP up. 

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. 

Aaron
Hey, did you guys? See that thing on TV last night? The concert. It was really beautiful music. 

Shawn
Ohh yeah. Oh yeah. Incredible. You seen that commercial? 

Hazel
Beautiful croaks. Yeah, yeah. 

Shawn
Have you seen that commercial where like I can't do it? But they're all like trying to go by the same laundry detergent at once and they. Frog Clippers keep on hitting each other. It's really great commercial. I I I recorded it on my VHS so I can watch it even when it's not being broadcast on television. 

Aaron
Yeah. Oh, yeah, no. Totally sold me on that brand of detergent I. Got to say it worked. 

Shawn
Me too. It's on the list. It's on the list for sure for. 

Hazel
Next, farm my little ****** suspenders have just never smelled better. Great detergent. 

Shawn
Hey guys. You ever notice? You just don't see blue or green cars as much. Now it's usually like black and Gray, yeah. 

Speaker 4
What is up with that? 

Aaron
Or red the occasional red. But occasional red yeah. 

Hazel
Yeah. If someone's really trying to show off. 

Shawn
White, silver, black. But you know, it's like wear the colorful. I remember back in the day that we had colorful cars. And I guess just people aren't buying them. I don't know. 

Hazel
The economy these days, they just want to make sure that they can resell their cars if they need to. It's harder to sell a green car, you know, and might match with people too much, yeah. 

Shawn
Right. Yeah, personality piece. 

Aaron
Who wants their skin the same color? As their car. That's yeah. 

Hazel
Exactly. Guys, do you ever. Guys, do you ever feel like? I feel like you just don't know what you're doing with your life. 

Speaker
Oh yeah. 

Hazel
Like working the same career every day. And for what? You know, sure. I'm bringing home the bacon for the for the little flippers over there. But I'm making really, really making a difference here. 

Aaron
All the time. I think everybody feels like that sometimes it's it's normal, not just you, you know. 

Hazel
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks guys. 

Aaron
You're doing so great. 

Hazel
Thanks. Thanks guys. That really means a lot. 

Shawn
There's. There's no one I'd rather be hanging out in it. Just chilling in water like this. Yeah. Because you and and you know what life is about more than achieving things. It's more about achieving a great career. It's about relationships. It's about time together. It's about the little ones, you know. 

Speaker 2
Yeah. 

Speaker
Yeah. Hmm. 

Shawn
It's about watching great commercials on TV. 

Aaron
Yeah. Speaking of the water that we're in, yeah. Do you guys want to swim around a little? Bit it's like, yeah, I love swim, you know. Yeah. Yeah. 

Shawn
Ohh, I'd love to. I love swimming. Yeah, little flippers and just. Yeah. Brings me back to my tadpole. Days. 

Aaron
Yeah. 

Speaker 4
Let's go. Let's go. Get in there. 

Hazel
With them, yeah. 

Shawn
But yeah, now that you mentioned the water, isn't it great how you can do? 

Aaron
Like water, I love drinking water. Yeah. 

Shawn
Absolutely in it, yeah. 

Hazel
As swimming is, you know it's been so long since I've written that down in my list of things I'm grateful for. 

Shawn
Oh well you should. 

Hazel
I'm writing. I'm writing down right. 

Shawn
Write. It to put it in there today. Yeah, that's good for your mental health. Help you with that earlier issue you mentioned. 

Speaker 4
Now. Yeah. 

Hazel
Yeah, I'm thankful. I'm always thankful for the water. 

Aaron
I've been meaning to start a gratitude journal. You just reminded me. I'm gonna do it this time. I'm really going. To do it. 

Shawn
And that was three frogs in a slowly boiling pot of water, and now back to our show. So yeah, looking across the whole history of the deception of the oil and gas industry and also their own internal investigations, a lot of things became clear a long time ago to them, like, for example, that warming was kind of baked in and would show up later. So they became aware in, like, the 1980s climate change isn't really going to show up and like the. Emissions we're doing now are going to make climate change pop off later, so we got a lot of time to, like, drill, baby, drill before anyone's gonna get mad. And in 1980, Task force of the American Petroleum Institute, again through their studies, confirmed the broad strokes of CO2 induced global warming, which was a scientific consensus at the time. And Stanford Professor John A Lorman gave the predictions of the likely impacts of uncontrolled CO2 emissions over time, predicting 1° of warming by 2005 that would be. Barely noticeable by 20-30, eight 2.5° of warming, which would cause quote major economic cons. Sequences and by 20675 degrees of warming that he predicted would cause quote catastrophic global effects. So this is the internal information that the American Petroleum Institute is getting from their own studies that by 2005 everything's going to seem fine. But over time, as warming sets in, there's going to be major economic consequences. And then global catastrophe. This is what their own documents are telling them. 

Hazel
Well, I don't know about that because economics says if you follow from nordhaus's. Models that somewhere between 2.7 to 3.5°C the global economy actually reaches an optimal adaptation. If we do happen to hit 6° of warming, disastrous as it might be, the model says that we could expect damages between 8.5% and 12.5% of world GDP by the end of 2100. And if we hit all of the bad tipping points that scientists warn us about, that adds an extra 1.4% decrease in GDP. So. Actually, it's actually not that bad. 

Aaron
Interesting how the how the downsides they're framing are always how much will this affect GDP? Not mentioning like oh, is there, like massive climate events that are killing people? Is there like supply chain interruptions or is there? 

Hazel
Mm-hmm. It's always GP. Go it. Those aren't part of the model, so. 

Shawn
Does the world exist? 

Aaron
Are people. 

Shawn
Or is there just something called GDP? 

Aaron
That we all then in their homes. 

Hazel
Yeah, and and and this is funny because not even not even the papers that were critical of these models mention this, but it's kind of soulish that we talk about GDP in this way because low like. The global S the countries that are going to get hit hardest by climate change, have lower GDP's and so not only are you discounting those countries, you're you're just saying that the lives of those people there are worth less because their country has lower. 

Shawn
Oh yeah, and, you know, there's been so many times throughout the history of all this. Now this is just speculation on my part, but I bet you, you know, after we die, when the good Lord allows us to look at everything that happened in human history, we can confirm this. But there's been multiple times across the history of I'm not actually religious across the history of the oil and gas industry, there must have been multiple times where they showed them the graph of the planet. And they're like, these areas are going to get hit the hardest. 

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. 

Shawn
And these areas are gonna get hit not as hard. And they're like, oh, **** yeah, it works for. Us. 

Hazel
Yeah. So like, if that 12.5% GDP. Decrease happened specifically in poorer countries. That's not a slight decrease of our incomes. That's not a slightly worse quality of life. That's just a lot of people dying. That's just a lot of countries. GDP is going to 0 cause nobody's there anymore. But here in the rich. 

Shawn
And global refugee crises, yes. 

Hazel
World if. Yeah, here in the rich world, if we say 12.5% of. P It's not that big of a deal. 

Aaron
Cause yeah. Is it like gonna be 12.5% of our GDP and 12.5% of their GDP or is it going to be 12.5% globally and maybe like the bulk of that is happening to them and? 

Shawn
It is going to be 12% of computer chips and 12.5% of agriculture or is it going to be 1%? 

Hazel
100. Of agriculture. Yeah, yeah. 

Shawn
1%. These are important considerations. 

Hazel
Well, are they? Not? According to these guys. 

Aaron
A lot easier on the grass to just look at GDP overall. Kind of total GDP globe. 

Hazel
Yeah. Well, I mean, if if you actually do want to just like, take their analysis at face value, if we are talking about the fact that, oh, if Edmonton gets to LA temperatures, Edmonton will be fine. Then if somewhere near the equator, some I I don't know name a hot name name a hot city for a dollar name a hot city. If like Mexico City. 

Aaron
What percent? 

Hazel
Warms up by, you know, 5° that's unlivable, but **** those people. We care about people who live. In New York. 

Aaron
Yeah, they they can move to the Yukon to Hammonton. 

Hazel
They yeah, they can move to the Yukon. 

Shawn
To the models mentioned, what the effect on the economy would be if, say, some sort of like peoples climate Justice Council went to these aforementioned names and addresses and dragged them kicking and screaming into the street to bring them to The Hague and hold them accountable and seize their assets and so on. 

Hazel
That sounds like government overreach, for sure. 

Shawn
Oh, no. I I wasn't thinking the government would be involved at all. I. 

Speaker 4
Just. 

Speaker
The just. 

Shawn
People, it's the people. 

Aaron
Yeah. 

Hazel
Uh, well, they're too busy at their jobs. 

Aaron
Right. I'd be very interested at the economic impacts of that. They should get a study, yeah. 

Hazel
Let me run some numbers I'll get back. To you, Aaron. 

Shawn
I think it could be. I think it could be economy positive, honestly. 

Aaron
I think the GDP will go. Up, up, up, up. That GDP will just climb right up if you do a 50% increase in GDP according to my numbers. 

Speaker
That is. 

Shawn
If you could get a real. Study that got headlines. That was like GDP will go up by 15% if we arrest and try all these *************. That would be such a good media hit. 

Speaker
I bet you. 

Hazel
I bet you that I could do some nordhouse *** math and just be like, OK, so redistribution of money from the .1. Went to the say 50th percentile of income earners increases because it does. It increases GDP by a certain amount to redistribute money from like the very top 1%. Because the top 1% don't spend it, right? So it doesn't contribute to GDP. So this is this is yeah, you get it increase the monetary velocity or good for GDP, right. So. 

Shawn
Yeah. Increase the monetary velocity. 

Aaron
We will do a crowdfunding campaign for some economists. Let's. 

Speaker 4
We can we. 

Hazel
Can fudge some numbers. Let me get the boys together. Let's go. To the lab. 

Aaron
The economics lab, and we'll just. Do some math. We'll make some charts. We'll get the lines to meet. 

Hazel
Cut 2. 

Shawn
I actually. 

Hazel
Cut 2 me and the boys at the lab. 

Speaker 2
This is a. 

Shawn
This is no longer a joke to me. 

Speaker
Kick. 

Shawn
Kick starting a study which examines the GDP effects of arresting and trying all these *************. He actually could be one of the most impactful media hits of like the decade. 

Hazel
I know climate, media people, and I know economists. Let's do it. 

Shawn
Let's do it. We just shook hand in real life hands. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. 

Hazel
We shook hands. We should. Well, he should. That's a. 

Aaron
That's a finding finding. 

Hazel
We shook one hand each. 

Shawn
We. One hand each a total of two hands. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. That's math. That's the kind of math we're doing here. 

Shawn
We're doing it. Imagine that article. Imagine that conversation with your boomer dad. Like for real, like. 

Hazel
You'd have to explain what GDP is. I feel like the GDP thing only really like like the GDP conversation is really a Congress type thing like this is what you present to Congress. But like, if you try. To talk to your boomer dad about GDP. 

Aaron
Yeah, you just put massive economic benefits from from trying these people. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. 

Shawn
Imagine imagine you have like Biden or whoever the next geriatric is is like they're out on the campaign trail. And like, look, the evidence says. 

Speaker
We can. Yeah, I. 

Shawn
You arrest and try these *************. It's good for the economy. 

Hazel
Yeah, I show up in my lab coat and glasses, and I'm, like, carrying these papers. 

Speaker 4
Like, look, look, I just got a. 

Shawn
Report, but you wouldn't have to even cook the numbers. It just makes sense. It'd be good for the economy. 

Hazel
No. Again, redistribution of wealth from the top 1% contributes to GDP. This is true. Ah. 

Speaker 4
Biden, Biden, me and the boys just got back from the lab. You'll never believe what we found. 

Shawn
Listen here, Jack. We're going to drag them kicking and screaming into the streets and bring them to The Hague. This is by genomics. 

Hazel
This is middle out economics. 

Shawn
Yeah. So another thing that we talked about talking about is the oil industry's meme game. 

Aaron
Yeah, I was talking about the various organizations and stuff that they have created over the years and they've, you know, really kept up with the times. They continue to create these organizations and to go other ways about it, to do things online. As you're saying, they're meme game. You mentioned at the beginning of the episode Hazel Women for natural gas because we were talking about it before it started. But yeah, one of the, you know, keeping up with the times, the natural gas isn't just for men anymore. It's for women. Yeah, I got this from a climate town episode on YouTube. There's also a Mother Jones article about it, but there's this, you know, fake organization they created called Women for natural gas. And the one thing that I found really funny about it is that when you look at the names of the women that they created fake quotes. Or they are Natalie White, Natalie Smith. With Carrie White and Rebecca Washington, these are all four women, four fake women. 

Shawn
For real natural gas. 

Aaron
Who love natural gas, whose images are Shutterstock photos, and one image was stolen from a LinkedIn executive who said that you know her name is not Carrie White and she is not in favor of women for natural gas, but they just, you know, created these things, made fake quotes as part of their propaganda campaign. A nice. Multicultural spread of women's images. Different racial groups, but all with these Natalie White, Natalie Smith, Carrie White, Rebecca Washington. I don't. Know. Those four names are just really funny to. 

Hazel
Me. Can you can you read us? 

Aaron
A quote natural gas does more than heat your home or power your stove. Natural gas saves. 

Speaker
Sure. 

Aaron
Water and lowers carbon emissions compared to a lot of other power source. Sounds like a thing in a normal woman would. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Aaron
Say. 

Hazel
Yeah, ladies, natural gas isn't just for housewives anymore. It does more than power your fridge and your oven. It can also power your vibrator. 

Aaron
Wow, that's. 

Hazel
I'm Hazel, Caucasian, and I'm. Here to. That's female empowerment. 

Aaron
Yes. 

Hazel
This episode of Seriously Wrong is sponsored by Girlies for natural gas. 

Shawn
Ladies, Are you ready to go to the club and our? Polyester. Ohh yeah. 

Hazel
How do you want to get there? Let me guess. Drive there. Oh my gosh. I was talking to Gregory the other day and he's so hot. But he says that he thinks we should end fossil. Fuels I got the egg. 

Aaron
Red flag. 

Hazel
Red flag. So white left. 

Aaron
Yeah, it's like all those solar Bros on Tinder. Left, left. 

Hazel
Wind. Water, solar. Gag me with a spoon. 

Shawn
If a guy doesn't support clean, fracked natural gas to increase our energy. Thank you. Next. 

Aaron
It's like, don't you know that natural gas is a safe, reliable source of energy that provides countless numbers of jobs? 

Hazel
So true, Jennifer. Thank you. Who's powering the world? Jennifer White, Taylor Swift. 

Shawn
And I'm Honda Civic and we are. 

Hazel
Girlies from natural gas. 

Aaron
Girls for. 

Hazel
And I think a woman's place is in the oil. Build we're natural gas girlies, of course we cook grilled dinner on our gas stove. 

Aaron
Don't even talk to me in the morning until I've had my pumpkin Spice Frappuccino. 

Shawn
We are a totally grassroots bottom up organization to support women who support natural gas no matter what the boys. 

Hazel
Say natural gas. It's not just for boys anymore. 

Aaron
This advertisement on seriously wrong has been brought to you by the men behind women for natural gas. 

Shawn
Hi, my name is Chris Penas. 

Aaron
And I'm Chad. 

Shawn
Oilman, when we're doing fake Astroturf oil and gas, this information campaigns, we thought, how can we connect with wider groups? 

Hazel
People, why leave 50% of the entire population out of our disinformation campaign? 

Shawn
And that's when me and a couple of the fellas came up with girlies for natural gas so we can connect, you know, with the common people. 

Hazel
We love identity politics. 

Aaron
The men behind girlies for natural gas. Proud sponsor of today's episode. Another organization that they created called Frack Feed, it's a website slash Facebook page Slash Instagram page it no longer exists after it was exposed in a series of articles as being a subsidiary of Texans for Natural Gas, which is a project of FTI Consulting which is a oil and gas industry. Consulting firm but yeah, frack feed existed from 2015 to 2020. One created some amazing memes such as a picture of baby Yoda looking sad with impact font saying when you realize not everybody knows about fracking's many benefits. Poor baby Yoda, he's so sad. 

Hazel
TFW. 

Aaron
Or the minions with impact font. They're looking really happy, as minions often do. Saying Texas is making America more energy secure. 

Shawn
Right click, save as. 

Aaron
Bottom text or what about the image of the you know the sort of utopian image that we've all seen, you know, the like flying cars. 

Shawn
Social. 

Aaron
Outdoors looking really livable. A person walking their dog outdoors. There's lots of green space. The buildings look futuristic. 

Hazel
Natural gas powered flying cars. 

Aaron
Society, if everybody understood the benefits of the oil and gas industry. 

Speaker
OK. Just kind of nice. 

Aaron
The person making these memes being like, and they got to post one per day. They're paying me for the like the lowest effort possible. Like, OK, what do what do other people make memes? 

Shawn
I got a text update for that one society. If we dragged those guys kicking and screaming into the streets and brought them to the. Hague bottom text. 

Aaron
Last one I'll mention was the clown makeup. You know there's sequence of putting on more clown makeup and they're saying. 

Shawn
Getting more and more absurd and more and more wrong with every step until they become a full plan. 

Aaron
Maybe if I protest oil and natural gas, yell, keep it in the ground, refuse to listen to facts about oil and natural gas, then people won't notice that I drive to work and use my cell phone and computer daily. 

Shawn
Ohh **** let. 

Hazel
Me in a rainbow wig and honk my nose because I'm just like. 

Aaron
Did you know? That. 

Hazel
Him for real? 

Aaron
Did you know that driving to work uses oil and that your cell phone is powered by oil? Probably. 

Hazel
My cell phones powered by hydropower, but whatever. 

Aaron
Well, you know, this meanness for Americans and for people who live in BC. 

Hazel
Oh, sorry, yeah. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Shawn
Yeah, if you oppose expanding oil and gas and putting CO2 in the atmosphere to unsustainable levels, that will boil the planet and commit a mass murder of human life in exchange for profit. Well, guess what? You're a hypocritical ****, aren't you? Because you were probably born in a hospital that had plastic in. 

Aaron
And like. 

Shawn
It. So no. Or what? No matter what, even if he went and lived in the forest and got completely nude and lived like a. Which you would still have been born in a hospital with plastics and petroleum products, probably driven home all before you even made any choices in the world. You hypocritical ***** ** ****. 

Aaron
You hypocrite. 

Hazel
For the viewers at home, he is slowly putting on face paint, painting his lips, putting on a rainbow colored wig, putting on a Red Nose. Yeah. 

Aaron
There it is. And you know I want to be like, OK, these memes are so bad that they're just wasting. Your money and it's pointless. You know, this isn't this isn't bad at all, but then I think about, like, all the boomers on Facebook will literally see these memes and be like, yeah, oh, yeah. 

Shawn
The roofs who? 

Hazel
All the comments just say Amen. Amen. Amen. 

Aaron
Yeah, we got to, you know, I got to take this to the local town meeting. 

Hazel
I checked. 

Shawn
Holding as I printed out me and so like arguing against solar panels being put in at City Hall. 

Aaron
These memes. 

Hazel
Yeah, we got to take this to the Omaha City Council guys. 

Aaron
So true, all these idiots just using their cell phone daily. 

Speaker 4
Search. 

Shawn
That reminds me of my. ***** ** ****. Nice. I can't wait to ******* tear into her at Thanksgiving and have a permanently damaged social relationship as a result of me living in a delusional world that's been funded by millions of dollars of oil and gas money over many decades. While they knew full well that they were misleading me. And I hope they never get dragged into the streets of The Hague because that would be so wrong. 

Aaron
Yeah. And like frack feed, it's so obvious. Like who? You know, even before you knew that it was a hold on subsidiary of Texans for Natural Gas, which is a project of FTI Consulting, it's like, OK. Who? You know who's making frack feed other than the oil and gas industry. But you know, there's, I have to imagine there's at least some more subtle sources of this kind of stuff that exists. And yeah, it's. It's sad and gross and scary and that's. They're doing this. They're poisoning the minds of the people online. 

Shawn
Sad. Sad. 

Aaron
And enraging your hand, yeah. 

Speaker
Of course. 

Hazel
Welcome back to anger cast. We were sad cast for a second, but we're back. 

Shawn
That's one great way to regain agency of a world that is out of control is to make that pivot from sadness to anger. It's true. 

Hazel
Can we real quick just reenact? Dad, why is my sister named Rose? 

Aaron
Because your mother loves roses, OK? 

Hazel
Cool. Thanks, dad. 

Aaron
You're welcome, fracking. 

Speaker 2
I really wish that we. 

Hazel
I was staring at it for so long. It's so good. 

Shawn
I really wish that, meme said you're welcome, clean, fracked natural gas like. 

Hazel
Oh my God, it's so good. 

Aaron
Fortune Cookie the love of your life will appear in front of you one day unexpectedly and in the background of the fortune cookie. It's just a an oil rig or what is it? A drill, oil thing, I think. 

Shawn
Was that 25 likes? 

Aaron
Yeah, 25 likes on that 41 likes on the you're welcome fracking kid. 

Shawn
Pathetic. 

Hazel
Oh. Frigging one comment? 

Speaker
So funny. 

Aaron
I'm not like the other moms. I'm a cool mom. I support fracking. 

Hazel
Ohh, she's definitely in women for natural gas. 

Aaron
Yeah, I hope so. Glenn Coco, is that a character? Amy Poehler played on something? 

Hazel
Is that Natalie white? 

Speaker 4
Or is it a bipolar? 

Shawn
Mean Girls. 

Hazel
Glen Coco was an off screen character in Mean Girls. I don't think they're. 

Aaron
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. 

Shawn
I feel like they got the meme grammar wrong there because like, she's not cool, right? 

Hazel
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's it's supposed to be that she's. 

Shawn
Like. Trying to be cool but. She's not right, right? 

Hazel
Yeah. 

Aaron
Right. 

Shawn
It's always fascinating when people get their meme grammar off. 

Hazel
Yeah, like it's. Yeah, they're secretly they're secretly right about that one where it's like I'm not a normal mom. I'm a cool mom. I love natural gas. And it's like, OK, cringe, mom, go away. Wait, scroll, wait. Scroll up. I need to see what unseen juice is protesters using oil and gas products. Unsea juice. 

Aaron
Those damn hypocrite protests there. I mean, yeah, the these are all the same medium over and over again. 

Hazel
No, please, my polyester shirt. 

Shawn
Hello everyone and welcome to hypocrite or not, I am your host Honda Civic. And today we've got our two contestants, Kayla and Derek, now, first. Kayla, I understand that you are a anti oil and gas activist. Is that right? What inspired you get involved in this inspiring movement? 

Hazel
Thank you for asking Honda. I decided to get involved in this activist movement when it. Looked into the faces of the little babies playing in the park outside and I just thought I just want a better future for them and I know that continuously burning fossil fuel is not the way for them to have a happy and prosperous and equitable future. So that's what I'm fighting for. 

Shawn
And how did you get here today, Kylie? 

Hazel
I took a bus. Thank. You. 

Shawn
A bus electric bus. 

Hazel
Or no, my my city is still working on rolling out electric buses. So this one was a natural gas powered I believe. 

Shawn
Oh, interesting. Do you support natural gas? 

Hazel
I I don't think that we should completely get rid of natural gas immediately because it would, you know, cause all sorts of problems. But I think that we should definitely phase out natural gas as quickly as we feasibly can. 

Shawn
That's interesting, considering how you got here, Kirk. Yes. Hi. So I understand from our producers that you're a Wall Street trader who also is it part of a rogue group of billionaires who hunts endangered animals, is that? 

Aaron
Right. That's exactly right. You got it. 

Shawn
And do you think that's like the right and? 

Aaron
Good thing to do, I think that the strong should kill the weak both in the marketplace and in the jungle, so yes. 

Shawn
Interesting, no further questions. Kylie. Yes, Honda. So when you were born and you were. A little baby. 

Aaron
Mm-hmm. 

Shawn
When you were driven home from the hospital, would that be in a gas powered? 

Speaker 4
I get I mean. Yeah, I I get, I guess. 

Hazel
So yeah, I don't remember being born, but. 

Shawn
Is everything. Is everything in your house made out of metal and wood and glass? Or is there some plastic products as well? 

Hazel
They I mean there's some plastic products in my house for sure. I mean, I try to be 0 waste, but it's just really hard with. 

Shawn
Interesting, sorry. My job, and it's not no. OK, this is interesting. Isn't everyone? Sorry. Go on. 

Speaker 4
Yeah. Now, now it's that's fine. 

Shawn
And do you use computers cell phones? 

Speaker 4
Yeah, I try to. 

Hazel
Try to use the Internet to spread my message. Is that OK? 

Shawn
It's just very interesting, isn't it, Kirk? 

Speaker
Hmm. 

Shawn
Do you have plastic in your house? Cell phones and computers? 

Aaron
Ohh yeah tons tons of all. 

Shawn
Three, and do you care what happens to the environment? No. 

Speaker
Hi. 

Shawn
In your ideal future, what would kind of the world be like? What sort of beautiful utopian green future are you hoping? 

Hazel
For well, I I guess I'm just hoping for a more equitable and sustainable, ecologically reciprocal future for our kids. You know, the nation's kids hopefully free of fossil fuels. You know, because I I just hope that we can keep warming under 2°. 

Shawn
And if you had someone like, say, a child who was very badly wounded and you needed to get them to a hospital, and your only option around to transport would be a gas powered vehicle, would you let the child die? 

Hazel
Umm. I I guess I would. 

Speaker 4
Drive I well, I probably call an ambulance. 

Shawn
Let's let's just assume for the sake of the question that that's impossible. So your only options are there, just as a binary option. 

Hazel
OK. I don't. 

Shawn
Have a car? No special. There's a car there and you can access it. And the kid will die. 

Hazel
There's a car there, OK? 

Shawn
If you don't, but it will survive if you do so sort of about the child's life, ultimately, and no extra information can change that pioneering. 

Speaker 2
Hmm. 

Hazel
Well, I mean, I just feel I just feel like this isn't really a fair question to ask cause like you haven't really asked Dirk any like hard questions you've. Just been really OK. 

Shawn
No, I'm just curious. I think everyone's just curious because we'd find it very interesting to know where you stand on this as an anti oil and gas activist because we're just kind of curious about the consistency of people's ideologies on on the show, hypocrite or not. 

Hazel
Well, I just feel like you're not asking him any typical questions. I would. I. OK. OK. Thank you. I would. I guess I would drive the gas car if it meant the kid would otherwise die. OK, because I care about the future generations. 

Shawn
OK, I'll give him a hard. Question next, I promise. Interesting. Kurt. So Kirk, I need to give you a hard question here. Just like we we've given Kylie same question if you were faced with this unfortunate choice either drive a gas powered vehicle to save the child's life or let the child die, which would you pick? 

Aaron
Honda yeah. 

Speaker 2
MHM. 

Aaron
Well, that is a difficult one because I love gas powered vehicles, but I also have contempt for weakness. And as you know, babies are some of the weakest humans there are. They're creepy little necks, can't even hold up their heads. So. 

Shawn
That is hard. 

Aaron
I guess I would just let the child die and then just drive the vehicle around. Maybe do some doughnuts, maybe go on a trip. Maybe just just Rev the engine right there beside the playground. 

Shawn
Right. And is that consistent with the world that you would like to ultimately create? Like are you embodying the values of the world that you wish for the future and? Doing. 

Aaron
So without building profits for the oil and gas industry, yeah, who I am work for and invest in. And it would mean fewer weak babies in the world. So it's a win win all around. Yeah. 

Hazel
So. So so it's OK that he has a deeply evil ideology, just as long as it's ideologically consistent. 

Aaron
Well, that is the point of the show, isn't it? 

Speaker 4
Ohh yeah. 

Shawn
I think I've heard enough. Kirk, congratulations. You are our winner. You have no hypocrisy whatsoever in any aspect of your ideology, and you get an all expenses paid trip to. 

Aaron
Guam. Wow. Oh my God. Thank you. I've always wanted to win a game show. 

Shawn
And I'm sorry, Kylie, but you're a huge ***** ** **** hypocrite and you can't be taken seriously. And I'm going to open a trap door on the floor that will make you fall down into a pit of despair. Any last word? 

Speaker 2
We wait. 

Hazel
Wait, wait. No, wait, wait, no, let let me. 

Shawn
Big red lever. 

Speaker 2
Ohh God no. 

Shawn
That's all the time we have this week for hypocrite or not, everyone, thank you for joining us. I am Honda Civic, your humble host and come back next week where we send another oil and gas executive to Guam. No, it's something that angers me. 

Aaron
No, I don't. What is? 

Shawn
It, well, there's something called the global climate Science communications plan. I found it from it's called the deception dossiers, which you can look up, which was a project that was done by the Union of Concerned Scientists, where they revealed the number of internal documents. And in this climate communications plan, this is from the late 90s. They made a multi pronged plan for how they were going to mislead the public lobby politicians and prevent the Kyoto Treaty from being. Identified so one of the things that they used was cherry pick data to give the impression of internal debate on climate science, where there was no meaningful debate, big oil would fund a climate think tank, the global climate Science Data Center, which would appear independent and be an authority on climate change and would strongly influence political life and media with misinformation again. Giving the idea of a internal debate which doesn't exist. And they would target politicians and teachers and other authorities to try to push a consensus that the Kyoto Treaty had no valid scientific basis. Climate change is just the theory. There's a lot of internal debate, and we should be very cautious about putting in public policy it related to climate change and so on, the document states. Victory will be achieved when the recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the conventional wisdom and those promoting the Kyoto Treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality. These lying *****. Knew that they were lying, and they knew that they were trying to achieve something for the purposes of making more money. And they have created a world which is dying where we are losing biodiversity. We're having unprecedented weather events and unprecedented. Farming and it's genuinely dangerous. When you go to the park and you see the little kids playing, is genuinely dangerous for them. What they did. This is an attempted murder in progress. 

Aaron
And in some cases, a successful murder. Alrighty. Just to be clear, you know, people have died. 

Shawn
Yeah, people dying from heat waves from flooding. From pollution from the combustion of oil and gas, creating things like asthma, increasing rates of heart disease, we're we're dealing with the mass murder of millions of people. In progress right now, if we stop today and not a single other person died. It would take a long time to figure out exactly how many millions, but we're dealing with a oil and gas industry sponsored mass murder of humanity which is currently underway and is not an exaggeration. So how ****** is that? A lot. 

Speaker 4
A lot. 

Aaron
Very. 

Hazel
See, when I say this at parties, nobody invites me back. 

Shawn
It's all on how you say it. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Shawn
It was a little wink. Hey, you guys ever think? How the how it's kind of like a mass murder of humanity under and then just like a little like millions are already dying folks. And it's like ohh, Hazel, you you you always you always bring pertinent information. 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but I'm already wearing my clown makeup at that point. So they're like we're. Just chilling. 

Shawn
Like putting on the clown makeup like we are not currently murdering millions of people for the profits of the oil and gas industry. 

Speaker
Yeah. 

Shawn
Because you got to say the opposite. Of what you mean? 

Hazel
Yeah, yeah. 

Aaron
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what else there is to say. It's ******. It's bad. 

Shawn
I mean, it's some small consolation that we know who to blame. 

Aaron
I mean, yeah, pretty, pretty small. 

Shawn
Unless. What if? Held the firms and individuals who have already murdered millions of people and stand to murder many millions more for profit, legally accountable in a global Criminal Court type process that would seize and redistribute the assets of the oil and gas industry. Towards an ecological transition that would also help mediate the variety of mass climate events ahead of us, including the displacement of billions of people in the largest refugee crisis that the human species has ever faced. 

Speaker 2
Yep. 

Shawn
We genuinely made a deep transition to the best of our ability, in good faith towards an energy system which does not kill all of us, which would probably include reducing the total amount of energy use and throughput, but not necessarily at the expense of having a good life. And what if we started doing this very soon in a way that worked really well? And then there was a future. 

Aaron
Yeah, I mean that sounds pretty. 

Hazel
I'm plugging it into the calculator. 

Aaron
Good. How will it affect GDP, Bing. 

Speaker 4
How will it? 

Aaron
GDP. Good it would. Good for GDP? That's what my calculator says. 

Hazel
Numbers are coming. Through. Good. 

Shawn
It's so interesting. I mean, ecology and economy both start with eco, which comes from Greek for home. Now, if you're following me, I know this is a little esoteric, but it's fascinating because over the last many decades, we've had a choice. To engage one of them as real at the expense of the other. Because we designed this economic system that is at odds with ecology, instead of making it, you know, compatible with ecology and like, genuinely like there's congressional testimony, where it's like one side is like ecology and then the other side is like economy. 

Speaker
Hmm. 

Aaron
The same thing, yeah. 

Shawn
And then the the economy side like, pulls the Democratic politician aside, and they're like, if you pick a college, you're getting ******* primary and we're gonna ******* ruin your life. And he's like, oh. 

Hazel
Geez, and this this is another like we we hear about the manufacturing of false debate between. The climate denying scientists who are very few and very well paid, I'm sure, and the real scientists who do real science. But this is kind of another manufactured debate of ecology versus economy, when actually if you ask a lot of economists, it's not like we have to make this big sacrifice of 10 percent, 12% of GDP or whatever to save. The planet a lot of people think that no, this is just a better. Like this? 

Shawn
A system of accounting that includes a. 

Hazel
Yes, yes. 

Shawn
Would be beneficial. 

Aaron
The economy is inside of the ecology, like you can't have an economy if the ecology is ****** because the economy requires people to produce things they need to be fed, they need to have places to live. They need to like. Like the the economy is a second order thing with the ecology below it. And if you don't take care of like the baseline of like the planet not killing us all, then we can't have an economy anymore. If everybody's dead, there is no economy. So like pitting them against each other. It doesn't make any fundamental. Sense if you don't have one, you can't have the other one at all. So. 

Hazel
The the economy is inside of ecology and the inside is inside of the outside. 

Aaron
Exactly. You just really got to get. This like. 

Hazel
Nailed it. 

Aaron
Russian nesting dolls people gotta figure out how this stuff works, and then it all falls into place. 

Hazel
Yeah. 

Shawn
Yeah. And we can just do so much better for each other and for, for, for people, you know, like. 

Speaker 2
Look. 

Aaron
And like you know, it might make, it might say, share my anger a little bit to see these people dragged into the streets and brought to court or whatever. Like, I don't even they don't even have to be dragged. They can be nicely walked and like honestly like they don't even have to go to like a horrible prison. They can go into like a nice rehabilitation center. 

Shawn
Yeah. Per block sign. 

Aaron
Nice room. I I really. I just want them to stop more than anything. Like they don't even have to be punished beyond like, obviously their asset. Need to be seized. But that's not like a punishment. That's more of just like basic economic justice. And yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's not like, ohh, I'm like flogging you for taking a bike or something. I'm not. You know, they don't have to be flogged. Wild dogs don't have to eat their genitals, live on TV or anything. They I just. 

Shawn
Yeah, if you steal a bike, you don't. Get to keep it. 

Speaker 4
God demands the dogs. 

Aaron
They just, they just have to stop the mass murder campaign has to be stopped. 

Hazel
Yeah, I wonder what's going to come of all of these new lawsuits against, because they're like individual lawsuits to stop this fossil fuel infrastructure of that false fuel infrastructure. But there's, like, a big wave. Of. States governments suing big oil groups of companies for obscuring climate change and for damaging the environment. Many states are doing this. Governments are. Doing this as I would like to point out a result of the end fossil fuel movements happening everywhere, but anyways, like how, like how close are we with that or is that not close enough? 

Speaker 2
All those. 

Aaron
All those class action lawsuits that they predicted, like it would be cool if a lot of those really popped off and then the oil companies went bankrupt. 

Hazel
Or at least you know couldn't afford to make these terrible memes that I'm still staring at anymore. There's right there. 

Aaron
Yeah, just leave those up on this constant. 

Shawn
So I think what's really needed is a map. 

Speaker
This. 

Shawn
New consensus and obviously I support any and all class action lawsuits against the oil and gas industry, but a lot of these things, you know, I I was looking there's this uh bigoil.ca which is like a BC lawsuit that Vancouver City Council previously backed. But then we got a right wing mayor and they withdrew support from it and. They're saying, you know, we got to make sure that big oil pays their fair share of climate mitigation. And so this is like probably you know stress tested messaging with like Joe average or whatever, but it's not really about this is the thing about these class action lawsuits. It's not about making them pay their piddling quote UN quote, fair share, which is some fraction of what's going to be required, like genuinely their fair share is for them to cease to exist. Because they're the stakes of this is like whether or not babies survive, like whether or. 

Aaron
Yeah. 

Shawn
People survive. So like when we talk about. 

Hazel
Or at least organized society survives. 

Shawn
Yeah, like, do. Are we on a path to a Mad Max type scenario and even genuinely the potential of human extinction or not? When I think about your fair share in that kind of context, there's no greater stakes than the sort of stakes of the. And gas. So. I think we need to support these class action lawsuits and support things like this in any way that we can, but even further than that, we need a consensus, a political consensus, to hold them accountable on a higher level on a global level and with new legislation like there needs to be new legislation. If we go through the existing court systems, if we go through existing. Laws we can get some wins here and there, but it's totally insufficient for the level of crisis we have super villains on planet Earth who are murdering millions of people and will murder millions more. And the only way that we can really hold them accountable is the. To mass movements, mass consensus, and new laws in ways that you know the specifics of are hard to predict, but the amount of responses required to be proportionate is enormous because the stakes are enormous. 

Hazel
And so these these lawsuits, I mean, I I agree with you 100%. I think these lawsuits help build up momentum for that where it's like, oh, I think I think a lot of people don't realize that other people feel the same way as them about how bad it all is. But as soon as you start seeing, oh, California is suing Big Oil for lying about climate change, it's it definitely builds up. Momentum for the kind of thing that. You're talking about, yeah. 

Shawn
All right, everyone, it's 3:30 PM at the oil and gas company. Pick up your baby and put it in the baby grinder at the end of the hall to get your oil and gas money line up. What's with the glum faces? Hey, come on, we do. 

Aaron
This everyday guys. Hey there, little guy. At that I got it. 

Shawn
Don't name it, you don't. 

Aaron
Even know what's coming? Do you don't name? 

Shawn
It I'm serious, it causes major issues. 

Hazel
Can I name mine money? Pinata is that. 

Aaron
Right. I think a dehumanizing name like that isn't isn't so. 

Hazel
Bad last one. I named cash sack and that one went through the Grinder just fine. 

Speaker 4
Shut. Shut up. You. I'm about to make a lot. 

Hazel
Of money off you. Hey, hey, hey. Tight. Hey, tight watch this. 

Aaron
Ohh wow that's you got. 

Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Aaron
A great throwing on. That's amazing. 

Shawn
You know, they knew as early as the 1950s that we would have to do this. To keep the money coming in. They're so wise. 

Speaker
Here, here, here you want. 

Hazel
Me to do yours, you look. A little attached to it. Yeah, all. 

Speaker
All right, all right. 

Aaron
I appreciate it. 

Speaker
All right, so you want to say? 

Hazel
You want to say. Goodbye to you. Say goodbye to your friend. No. Kobe. 

Shawn
Ohh damn hit the. 

Aaron
Rim. Ohh. I got some blood splatter on my face. That's always. 

Hazel
The rim shots are always the worst ones. Alright, let me just scoop this up and. 

Aaron
Always. 

Hazel
There you go, little money pinata. 

Aaron
Yeah. Put that in there too, yeah. 

Shawn
You. We got to find some way to have this be done far, far away where we don't have to look at it or think about it, because this is really hard to do. But if we could somehow. 

Aaron
Yeah, I mean. 

Shawn
Take it outside and you know not have to do it directly. Then I'd feel much. 

Hazel
Better about it, right? My arms getting sore from chucking all these babies. 

Aaron
Yeah, I mean, I try to put on a brave face, but I do feel sort of dead inside. I would say, right. But since I've felt dead inside, it has gotten easier. So, you know, costs and benefits, pluses and minuses. 

Speaker
Hmm. 

Hazel
I just, I just think about the the little baby faces on my little babies and. 

Shawn
Supply and demands. 

Hazel
How much they're? They're gonna inherit from me doing all this baby chucking, and I think it's it's all worth it once you just go home to him, you know. 

Aaron
Yeah, that's true. 

Hazel
That's what you gotta remember who we're doing this for. 

Aaron
You gotta have some babies to feed. Other babies. Baby, baby. 

Hazel
It's a baby baby world out here. 

Aaron
Yeah, we don't have to like it in order to, you know, accept it. Although I would say at at this point, I do kind of like it. 

Speaker
Hmm. 

Hazel
It's literally just the way of the world. People who think we shouldn't be shredding babies. They don't. Get what it's like. 

Shawn
And that was 3:30 PM at every oil and gas company every day. Now, back to our show. Well, that's just about all the time we have today, everyone, but it's a pleasure speaking about this subject with you, Hazel and and Aaron and. Mm-hmm. One of the things about this is that we've actually just sort of scraped the. Of an unbelievably large amount of documents, so we're going to have some show notes in the description today, which will be very extensive, including multiple books that you may read dozens of articles and so on that we gathered in prep for this. And we're only able to read a small fraction. Have, but in particular I want to recommend big carbon strategic response to global warming, 1950 to 2020, a dissertation that was written by Benjamin Franta in 2022, which I found was a really great summary of a lot of this stuff that I found from a variety of places. And then also there is a recent book, the petroleum papers, that focuses a lot on the tar sands. So it's a Canadian writer shout out to. To everyone underneath this oil country. 

Hazel
Bowed out to our Petro state. 

Shawn
There's also a book that I really want to read, but I have not read called more heat than life, which is about the connections between neoliberalism, neoclassical economics, and funding from the oil and gas industry. 

Hazel
Which really makes a lot of the stuff that the people I'm I've quoted earlier say make a lot more sense. If that was all funded, I can only find sources that say that. Some of it was funded, but. 

Shawn
Yeah, the general thesis of the book, as I understand it, is that oil money from the earliest days of neoliberalism was a major financier. Of these kinds of pattern grid world ********, anti ecological economics that has caused our planet to be warmer than it's ever been. So we'll have links in the description to all of that and Hazel, where can people find more of your climate and economics content? 

Hazel
Yeah, I am. Hazel is online. Wherever you get your videos, TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Now starting making YouTube videos. So I guess I'm trying to get people over there, subscribe to my YouTube channel. And thanks for having me genuinely love this show, so it's been just a blast being on. 

Shawn
Well, yeah, thanks for coming on. I've learned a lot from your your talks as well. Your, your T OK? Yeah. 

Hazel
Apostrophe T OK. Right on. Cool. Thanks. 

Shawn
So I guess diversifying into YouTube will be useful if they like ban TikTok and stuff are. 

Speaker
Uh. 

Shawn
You worried about that like? 

Hazel
TikTok. So yeah, TikTok has actually kind of shadow banned me or I don't know what's going on on TikTok but I can't break 5000 views. So Instagram is where most people find me now. But yeah, I I think that it's definitely helped me realize that YouTube is a more reliable place to get information out because you're not at the whims of the algorithm so much. So yeah, find me there. Maybe. 

Shawn
Cool. And on the climate crisis, any closing thoughts for our audience from your years of study on the subject? Is there any extra take away messages that you want to throw out there to our attentive ears? 

Hazel
Sure. I guess I'll just say there's lots of examples in the past of genuine good policy and international cooperation. Spurred by the demands of the people through protests through activism that has genuinely worked, so like an example that I was talking about on YouTube is cap and trade cap and trade wouldn't solve the climate crisis at this rate, but it certainly made acid rain a lot less of a big issue than it was in the 90s because. People came together, organized, protested and forced international cooperation about that. Same with the kind of ozone layer that was regulations and international cooperation. So like this. There is sort of a light at the end of the tunnel of this. If we can just follow previous examples, but it's going to be a lot harder because the climate crisis is a lot more broad. I love this show because you guys don't just talk about the problems, but you talk about how to solve them. And I always say there's like. There's no way to solve a problem unless you learn the solutions and then learn how to demand them. So that's my ending. Thanks. Thanks again for having me on. 

Shawn
Yeah. Thanks for coming on and thank you everyone for listening. As I turn towards the audience. 

Speaker 2
Yay. 

Shawn
Climate anger, climate hope, climate action. 

Hazel
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think anger, anger and hope are like, the two biggest emotions that spur action. Despair, not so much. So try not to despair too much. Mostly just get mad. Worked for me. 

Shawn
Yeah, yeah. Work for me too. 

Speaker
Bye bye everybody. Bye bye guys. Bye. 

Hazel
Imagine I'm riding off on a train. 

Speaker 2
Goodbye. 

Shawn
Waving. Ohh, what powers that train? Hypocrite. 

Hazel
Leaving. 

Aaron
Solar solar. 

Hazel
Train solar train. I'm waving MY0 plastic napkin. 

Shawn
Rares. 

Speaker 2
Farewell. 

Shawn
Well, rare earth minerals in the solar train. Hypocrite. 

Speaker 2
You're seriously. Seriously, you're seriously, seriously wrong. You.
