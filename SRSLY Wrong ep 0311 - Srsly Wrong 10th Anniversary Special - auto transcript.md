Aaron
And we'll just stop recording. And that was the one thousandth episode of seriously wrong.

Shawn
Wow, what a wonderful, strange trip it's been. And now, 10,000 years of World Peace. 1000 episodes. Yeah, giving rise to the 10,000 years we've done it.

Aaron
10,000 years of World Peace. Yeah, we've always said just look out the window and yeah, things are changing out there. It's starting first a little, then a lot. We're really finally doing it. The grass is growing. People are playing hopscotch.

Speaker 3
Wow.

Shawn
The wildlife is returning. The eye is clearing that the.

Speaker 3
Sky.

Aaron
Global average temperature. I can see it going down right now.

Speaker 4
What a wonderful journey.

Aaron
This has been, yeah, lifelong podcasting journey, but worth it for these 10,000 years of World Peace to come, even though we won't see most of it, maybe just the.

Shawn
Start. Yeah, but that's natural. It is what it is and it's. Something you accept? Yeah, it makes me wistful. It makes me reminisce. You know, one of the standout episodes for me over the years. A real milestone and not, I mean, in many ways, an arbitrary miles. Down because we have a base 10 numeric system.

Aaron
But you're talking about the 10 year anniversary session.

Shawn
The 10 year anniversary special yes.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah, it was a great. I mean, the 20 and 30 year anniversary specials, those were good too. But there's something about that, that first one that.

Shawn
We still we had that young spark, so naive back then and as my I love reminiscing. But one of the types of reminiscing I love the most is reminiscing about reminiscing.

Aaron
No, no longer as Nice. Rum. Yeah, that was some good reminiscing. You remember that? You remember how we reminisced? Were the days reminiscing about the days?

Speaker 4
When you could really reminisce.

Aaron
Back then, yeah. And you only had 10 years of stuff to reminisce about reminiscing. Now. It's so overwhelming. There's so much to reminisce on.

Speaker 3
Yes, challenger.

Shawn
Good, simple, old fashioned reminiscing. The way that we used.

Aaron
To do it, we in some ways we didn't know how good we had it back then.

Shawn
You know what might be a nice treat for us? Old friend is pull out the tape of that 10 year special and just give it a listen, you know, to celebrate having finally made it through our 1000. If I could listen to myself. Ohh no. So it gets so self-conscious.

Speaker 5
I don't know.

Shawn
It's fine. You're fine. We did great. Don't worry.

Aaron
I guess maybe in my old age I can. Finally, let go of some of that self-conscious editing brain and just listen to an old episode and appreciate.

Shawn
It. Yeah. Here I'll just pull up the tape player and.

Speaker 3
Was this?

Speaker 5
We.

Aaron
Wheel it out one last time.

Shawn
And I'll slide in this tape. Here it is. Tapes feel heavier every year, although they're getting smaller every year for advanced futuristic I mean present tends to us, but futuristic to the past. I mean, I guess that's true of.

Aaron
Any present but yeah, the present is always the futuristic compared to the past. Yes, something you rarely think about when you're in it, but. We should.

Speaker 5
Well, I mean that's the.

Speaker 4
Of.

Speaker 3
Wisdom that you get with age?

Aaron
So I'll just press that closed 10 year anniversary special.

Speaker 4
Let's press play.

Speaker 5
It's.

Shawn
The year is 2014. Transformers and Guardians of the Galaxy are playing in theaters last week tonight, in True Detective season one, both premiered to rave reviews. Game of Thrones is at its peak in its third season. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappears. Mysteriously, ISIS announces a caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Russia annexes Crimea. Israel launches Operation Brothers Keeper killing 2300 Palestinians, 70% of which were civilians and wounding 10,000 more. Maroon 5 and Bobby Shmurda are tearing up the charts in America. The Seriously Wrong Podcast is born. The world will never be the same.

Aaron
Hello everybody and welcome to the 10 year anniversary episode of Seriously Wrong.

Shawn
A decade, so we've got 10 fingers on our hands and for that reason, the number 10. Umm. Carries a lot of weight in our.

Aaron
Culture. Yeah, we've created a base 10 numerical system, right? Where it switches from 1 digit to two digits. That's a big switch. It is? Yeah. And it starts counting over again. Like you go 11 instead of like, a new strange shape that we haven't invented yet.

Speaker 6
It's.

Shawn
Yeah, no, it's and this isn't something that's external in the universe. This is something we created basically because we have 5 fingers on each hand and then we built like.

Aaron
It makes counting easier. You fingers and toes. Goes and now 10 years of seriously wrong has passed, and this is a major milestone because of all of this.

Shawn
Yeah, it's a decade and it's a decade ultimately, because we have 10 fingers on each hand. On both hands combined, not each hand. Sorry. My mistake. Yeah, we have 5 fingers on each hand, totaling 10. Thank you. Therefore, numerically, a decade becomes a large important section of time and 10 becomes an important number. We can't change it. No one asked us.

Speaker 5
Oh, nice.

Shawn
And we're at peace with.

Aaron
It. Yeah, we're not here to fight the importance of the decade or of the number 10 in our society. We're just submitting to it and we're saying this podcast is now 10 years old and we're here to celebrate it.

Speaker 4
No, not at all.

Shawn
But we do want to point out that it's arbitrary just to get the wheels turning. It is arbitrary in many sense. It's not totally arbitrary, cause like we said, the fingers on hand.

Aaron
But yeah, if we lived in Simpsons world like it makes it would make more sense if in The Simpsons they had a base 8 system, but they don't.

Shawn
Right. Yeah, that would be very interesting. If in the cartoon world there was a consistent base 8 system that was used and they had their own math and so on. And I think that's something that our our cartoonists should consider, but we don't have time to do that ourselves today because we have to do a 10 year anniversary. So of seriously wrong. So thank you for being here. And thank you for listening. And thank you especially to those who donated on our Patreon. We couldn't do it without any of you doing all the things that you do your time and attention means the world to us, and we hope that our podcast means the world to you.

Aaron
And yeah, thank you to everybody who gave us questions. We put it out there that we were doing an anniversary episode and we asked people, what do you want to know about 10 years of doing seriously wrong about our thoughts and feelings on it. So we're going to be digging into all of those very soon coming up.

Shawn
Yes, but first let's have a word from our very real actual sponsor. Others who without them, we wouldn't be able to run the show because canonically in universe they're sponsoring it, which is how many shows are funded. Now. We don't actually run ads and I think we probably never will because we just don't like them. In fact, often I'll listen to a good show and I'll find the ads.

Speaker 3
Yeah.

Shawn
Are enough to keep me from continuing listening. And I would never want to do that to my dear beloved listeners. We use a Patreon and bonus episode model, so thank you to everyone who does that. But without further ado, let's go to our sponsors. Our real in Universe, Canonical sponsors who canonically in universe sponsor this episode, but not.

Aaron
Make it all possible.

Shawn
But not literally, literally. It's actually you, the listener, that makes it all possible, because we don't really run ads, and we probably never will. This episode of Seriously Wrong is proudly brought to you by wrong Boys Pizzeria brought to you in a decade or less, or it's free.

Speaker 4
Hello, Wrong boys pizzeria.

Aaron
I I'm going to need a pizza sometime between now and 10 years from now, but it kind of doesn't matter when.

Speaker
Oh.

Speaker 4
Perfect. We guarantee that it will arrive in 10 years or less. So it may arrive in exactly 10 years. That would be the absolute last moment. You could expect it, and if not.

Speaker 5
Perfect.

Aaron
It's free. Well, that's great cause I wouldn't need it after that. So yeah, that's right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 4
Yeah. So you can give it to someone else or, I don't know, put it in the fridge, but it may arrive today, but it could also arrive five years.

Aaron
Nine years, 364 days from now, I get it.

Speaker 4
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It could also arrive four years, three months and six days from now for.

Aaron
Example. So how do you decide? Is it random? You just flip a coin. Which one you're gonna do next or?

Speaker 4
Well, we just have a really progressive work culture. So we let people take the. Time make their own choices. Worker democracy takes up a lot of the day, no pizzas have gone out at all since we were created. But we've only been open for three months.

Aaron
All right. Well, I'll.

Speaker 4
Because I just think the hustle and bustle of the sorry for interrupting. But I think the hustle and bustle of the modern world is sometimes a little too fast and.

Aaron
Too much? No. I was just gonna say I'll just give you my credit card. Take my money.

Speaker 4
Perfect. Yeah. So we take the money now, and if it comes after 10 years and we'll give you back.

Aaron
And yeah. The money don't even mind paying now cause it it'll be such a good deal pizza. Who knows where food prices. Will be between one day to 10 years from now. They could be anywhere.

Speaker 4
Yeah. No, I can tell you're a very. Smart man, I like to. Plan ahead. So you pay $33 today and you get what it's gonna be worth $120.00 worth of pizza in nine years. And if not, it's free. We'll give you back your $33. You got nothing to lose.

Aaron
Nine years, 364 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 30 seconds later. Oh wow, this is really getting down to the line. I wonder if this pizza is going to show up. Hello.

Shawn
Hey I've got your. You ordered pepperoni right? Here you go.

Speaker 6
Yep.

Aaron
Thank you. And wow, with 15 seconds to spare. You guys did it.

Shawn
Well, we were very tightly round ship.

Aaron
I was gonna say I'm gonna get that refund, but I guess not, that's.

Shawn
No refund for you when the wrong boys make a word they.

Aaron
Stick to it. You know, I'm really proud of you and your company. You know, when I first talked to you, not a single pizza had been deliver. And now, as I understand it, you've delivered many pizzas and you delivered mine on time.

Shawn
Admittedly, there's been a few refunds right? I'll be the first to.

Aaron
Admit it, no company is perfect.

Shawn
But I can proudly say we have delivered the vast majority of the pizzas on time and the pizzas that were late were arrived. Given the pizza and then they got their refund.

Aaron
No, it's just such a great company. It's great looking back on 10 years of you existing and.

Shawn
Ohh yeah what a Long strange. Trip has been, and it was a real learning journey, sort of interrupts you, but it's a real.

Aaron
And I mean. You're. Learning journey and I feel like you're just entering a whole new chapter now. You'd only existed for three months when I first called, and now it's only been three months of time where you've actually been running up on deadlines, and I imagine that's kind of changed things in in your work culture a little bit and.

Speaker 5
Hmm.

Shawn
Yeah, it's, it's stressful. But you know, as an ADHD child, I find a little bit of stress stimulating.

Aaron
Right. Is it like a a list of orders and dates and kind of like a A?

Shawn
Absolutely. We keep something almost exactly like that.

Aaron
An excel sheet, what kind of data software do you use?

Shawn
We use a CRM system a a client. I can what it stands for. Maybe you could look it up, but CRM is what they're called or you have a list of people and then you associated characteristics. And so any most organizations will have that.

Aaron
OK. I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker
Nice.

Shawn
For like a list of people, they're sort of data system.

Speaker
Right, yeah.

Aaron
Cool. Well, I'm gonna go eat this pizza before it gets cold, but thank you. And here's to another 10. Years. Ohh.

Shawn
Thank you so much. Do you want? To place another.

Aaron
Order. Yeah, I'll. I'll do it over the phone.

Shawn
I don't wanna keep you. You're ohh. That's no problem at all. I can come in. And you can. Start eating and we could talk it out. Or are you busy?

Aaron
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah. No, not really. I'm just gonna eat pizza.

Shawn
But cool. Yeah, well, we don't have any, like, hard commitment like this is the last one for today. So we no. So I can talk about the business.

Aaron
Yeah. Or whatever. Yeah, no, that'd be great. Maybe this will be the. Start of a friendship maybe? Yeah. Maybe. Or maybe not. I don't want to put expectations on it so soon.

Shawn
Ooh, feeling pressured now.

Aaron
But.

Shawn
Just kidding. No, you seem like a chill guy. I think. I think we could both feel out. If it's not working socially.

Aaron
Right. Yeah, sounds great. Yeah. Come on in. And fun fact, this pizza would cost $700.00 today, and I only paid $33 for it. It's a pretty.

Shawn
Good deal. Yeah. Look at you. Go to come after you're ripping me off now. I'm just kidding. It's all worked into our business.

Aaron
Plan. We had no company makes it 10 years without a strong business plan so.

Speaker 7
Thank you so much for saying.

Shawn
Anyway, so basically the premise is the pizza comes within 10 years and that's what started the business.

Aaron
Ohh yeah, and was your business. Did it just arrive from nothing or did you have sponsors? Is your business sponsored by anyone?

Speaker 7
Ohh yes no.

Shawn
Thank you for asking. We'd actually did have many sponsors early on because obviously in those early years we were just taking in money and delivering. No pizza and we were paying wages, right? So we had to have some way to add pizza to it, right. Do you mind if I play you a short tape on my? I've got a handheld tape player. It's just my personal this isn't this.

Aaron
I'm just eating this pizza. Amazing how small tapes are getting nowadays.

Shawn
Yeah. So much smaller than 10 years ago. I mean, I guess the the future is now is what they say.

Aaron
Lighter too. This pizzeria is proudly brought to you by seriously wrong boy, the anthropomorphized human form of the Seriously Wrong podcast.

Shawn
Hi everyone my name is seriously wrong boy. Thank you so much for supporting my development as I've come from a baby now to a adolescent. But doctors say that I'm badly sick and in need of medicine.

Speaker 7
Oh man.

Shawn
Which is very expensive. Can you please consider donating to the seriously wrong Patreon? At the tier of $6 a month which gets you access to the whole archive and all the bonus episodes and the patriarch community on Discord, exclusive access to occasional text posts and frequent bonus episodes.

Aaron
Question from the audience will donating to the seriously wrong Patreon keep you alive? Little sickly boy?

Speaker
Yes, exactly.

Shawn
Every dollar that is given to seriously wrong increases the seriously wrong point anthropomorphized version of the podcast Medicine fund. I'm a human being and I will literally die.

Speaker 7
Without your support. For real?

Aaron
How that poor, sick little boy, we have to keep him alive. That was just a podcast. It would be morally neutral if we kept him alive. But since it's a real little anthropomorphic boy, we better donate.

Speaker
Hi.

Speaker 7
I could give the maximum donation, save the sweep.

Aaron
Our call lines are open. You can call and give your credit card number or head over to patreon.com/seriously wrong and help this little anthropomorphized podcast boy who is very. Sick and very in need to help him out. We thank you for your donations.

Speaker 7
Hey, wait a minute. Sean and Aaron created this sick.

Aaron
Boy, I actually we didn't create him. An evil wizard turned our podcast from a podcast into an anthropomorphic boy, and we've been tasked with keeping him alive, so it's not. We did create the podcast, but we didn't turn it into a boy.

Speaker 7
Oh well, that deals with all my concerns and I'll be donating soon.

Aaron
Thank you. Thank you for your help with this. And if anybody knows where that evil wizard is, we want to have a word with him. Obviously, don't undo the spell because I would now be kind of like killing a boy who currently exists. Now that he exists, he has to keep existing as far as I'm concerned. But. We still want a word with them because you can't go around turning podcasts into people.

Shawn
Yeah, that's true. And sometimes it takes magic to fight magic and right. You can't just stop here at this unjust situation. Nor can we go back to an idyllic earlier one. We have to move forward or to the side, or maybe do a loop or whatever. But we need to move towards something new. We can't just undo the boy. I think that would.

Aaron
Be wrong and you know, we promised we would never have real ads on the show. Real sponsors. But we have had to adjust our thinking on that and finally bring real sponsors to the show, to care for this anthropomorphic boy. It's very important. He's very.

Shawn
Sick. He needs real ads to support him. I mean, just look at him. Yeah, it's a real human life. We're talking about.

Aaron
So we're going to wheel out the tape player and it's with a heavy heart that we bring real ads to seriously wrong for the first time with.

Shawn
Working with tiny tape.

Aaron
Press play. This anthropomorphic podcast, Child's life and medical needs are brought to you by Aaron, a daytime talk show.

Shawn
It's Aaron. It's a daytime show that your family members watching in the background. Join Aaron every weekday with a sizzling new guests.

Aaron
And Mr. T Spiller, I can't believe you said that. I don't know if they're putting microchips in our bones, Felix, but I support your right to say.

Shawn
It tune into Aaron's book club.

Aaron
Our book this week is geek on Geet. The thinkers chronicles it's not a book. I think us will soon.

Shawn
Forget and watch Aaron dance. Get up out of your seat and dance with them if you want.

Speaker 7
Why?

Shawn
To shake things off. Now an exclusive clip from a new episode of Aaron's airing Tuesday.

Aaron
Welcome back, everybody to Erin. Our special guest this week is the producer of a new film about the wrong boys. His name is Sean. He's one of the wrong boys. I'm also one of the wrong boys. Welcome to the show, Sean. Thank you so much for. Being on thank.

Shawn
You for having me know it's a big I'm a huge fan of what you do. Not just on this show, but all of your work but.

Aaron
Yeah. No, me too. Everything you've produced as a film or podcaster, big, big fan as well. So it's an honor.

Shawn
That you're on. Well, it's an honor to be here. I'm. I'm here both as a producer of a film, but also as a huge fan and an unapologetic fan.

Aaron
So this new movie is a biopic with a lot of big name stars in it, chronicling the life of Sean and Aaron. You and me coming up from little Rugrats up until the podcasters and multimedia producer talk show host that we are today.

Shawn
Yeah, it's a biopic about the rise of the wrong boys in the Seriously wrong podcast, and when we were putting together this project we asked ourselves who could carry that gravitas, who's a big enough name. Frankly, we got a lot of offers from people and it's like, are you even famous? Like, how could you play them?

Aaron
I heard that you turned down Henry Cavill. Jake Gyllenhaal's gal.

Shawn
Yeah, it wouldn't be fair of me to say, but suffice to say there were some large.

Aaron
Names and I hear you are and actually announcing who's playing the wrong boys today on the show is.

Shawn
That right? That's right. We're really proud that I'm here as a producer, but I think everyone involved in the project is really proud to announce today that we have secured after some. Bidder and protracted negotiations to have the wrong boys portray themselves. So it'll be a biotic about them. There's also starring them at all ages throughout their lives.

Speaker
OK.

Shawn
We've seen from the show, you know, the kind of range that they have, the way that they can embody any age Lesly inaccurately.

Aaron
And I know the the the the technology is just there now it is.

Shawn
It's true, it's seamless, and yeah, I'm actually excited to not just be here to talk about it, but actually to show an exclusive clip to the viewers of Aaron. Now, for the first time, a world premiere.

Aaron
So in this first clip we joined the wrong boys as children, creating their first secret podcast. In the attic.

Shawn
Well, those bullies sure were harsh today just because we want to make podcasts and do auditory art. It's auditory art.

Aaron
Yeah, we're really trying to do something different with the medium of podcast, but these bullies don't understand. They think we're just not putting any effort into it or they're dissing the medium as a whole and it's like, give us a chance.

Shawn
Yeah. We can't let them get to us, even though it's day after day, every class. Every break private messages, cyber bullying, harassing phone calls. But we just you gotta move on, you gotta focus.

Aaron
On the work, the important thing is that no matter what anyone says or does, however, they try to stop us, that we keep on going because we believe in this. Yeah, that's all that matters.

Speaker 5
OK, so I'm thinking.

Shawn
Part the ad itself has a like its own ad, so kind of we can. Aaron. Aaron, what are you doing up here?

Speaker 4
John.

Aaron
Quick hide the recording and there's.

Speaker 7
My dad, he verbally abuses us everyday. What are? You doing?

Aaron
Nothing, Mr. Billy. We're just cleaning up up.

Shawn
Here. Yeah. I just wanted to contribute to the family's health and. Well-being, dad, you're not playing with that train set I told you for babies.

Speaker 4
Say.

Speaker 7
No, no.

Aaron
Are you? No. No, we're not podcasting either.

Shawn
Podcasting, huh? I've told you before, Sean. I've told you, Aaron. To never podcast. It's forbidden in this house and say, maybe if you're a smarter kid, a brighter kid, you know, more promising kid, I'd say, hey, maybe go for it, you know, try art. But no, not you, not you shot. And Aaron, you're no better. Neither of you could be podcasters. And you could never do it for 10 years. Ever. You know what, actually, Aaron, I'm going to call your dad. I'm going to put him on speakerphone. One second.

Speaker
Yeah.

Shawn
Hey, Aaron's dad.

Aaron
How's it going? Did you catch those boys doing something bad again?

Speaker 7
Yeah, they floated the idea.

Shawn
Of podcasting to me again.

Aaron
Floated the idea. Is there any recording equipment around? Hey, Aaron. Sean, what did I tell you about podcasting? I said I said no child of mine will be a podcaster and no friend of any child of mine will be a podcaster.

Shawn
They said they weren't doing it, but I don't.

Speaker 7
Oh my God look.

Shawn
It's the whole recording setup. This is going right. In the trash, boys. What did he tell you about podcasting too?

Aaron
Either and that's that. That's the rules in this House. And I assume in your House too, that. Yeah, I don't want to speak for your house, but I think we both agree on this, that these boys can't be podcasters.

Shawn
Yeah, no, I agree entirely, yeah. We're in full agreement on this and not only can they not be podcasters, but to do so as a moral failing, something that will cause them to be judged. It's the reason they're bullied at school and now, obviously you want to stand up for your own child. But sometimes you just can't. When you're getting that, the right kind of bullying at the right time for the right reasons.

Aaron
Most podcasters don't make any money, and frankly, these boys aren't creative enough to make money.

Shawn
Hear that, boys? He agrees with me. You. You both have no talent. Now, I don't understand. Both of you are both big losers, but you can do something meaningful with your lives. Even though podcasting is a job for big losers and your big losers.

Aaron
I mean, they can get like a mid level job somewhere or do something mildly beneficial to society, but that's about it. No podcasting for sure.

Speaker 3
Yes.

Shawn
Not in my house and not in his house. Podcasting is the Devil's audio give up.

Aaron
Wow, that was harrowing. What the wrong boys had to go through there. That's.

Shawn
Yeah. No, it's not fun to watch. It's not meant to be fun to watch and say that as a producer, it's meant to shock because what the wrong boys went through? Yeah, starting this process, it's no laughing matter. And so we get through his awareness about and it really shows what they overcame, which is why they're the folk heroes.

Speaker
Really.

Shawn
That they are.

Aaron
Absolutely, yeah. Every inspiring story has to have its dark moments, and this one is no exception to that. I mean, even if there were some creative liberties taken in the process, that's just the way that these biopics work. I think the emotional truth of these scenes speaks for themselves. And there's like.

Shawn
Absolutely. Yeah. You know, there's an art. You take some liberties to tell deeper truths, like for example, scooper. He is actually an amalgam of several real life bullies. Right. But in our movie we have scooper follow them through the years.

Speaker
Hmm.

Aaron
An amazing performance too by Geet Finkas in that role.

Speaker 3
Yeah, no.

Shawn
He absolutely killed it, and actually my son and his son are now playing softball together. So we really hit it off on the film.

Aaron
Wow. Yeah. That's so nice. Yeah.

Shawn
Yeah, he's just as nice as people say, and I'm honored to call him a friend.

Aaron
We will be back with more of the wrong boys story, but first Aaron is brought to you by the Seriously wrong podcast and we are going to, I believe, play a clip from their ten year anniversary show.

Shawn
Ohh incredible really looking forward to that.

Aaron
Right now, so roll the clip.

Shawn
So here in the seriously wrong anniversary listener mail bag. One of the things that the good people want to know is how do we get started with this? One of the questions here, what motivated you to start doing this crazy thing in the 1st place? And did you think back then they'd still be going strong a decade later?

Aaron
Yeah, I think I've always been motivated to. Create things like make creative works, make stuff. Basically my whole life I've been working on various projects of different kinds trying to write novels, screenplays. Before we started the podcast, I had done a little bit of YouTube stuff and made some YouTube videos. Briefly did another podcast by myself, kind of floundered out after like 10 episodes because I didn't keep the motivation to keep doing it. But yeah, I don't know. It's whatever it is that's motivated me to do this. It's just something that's kind of always been.

Shawn
There. Yeah, I had made cartoons as a teenager, like the Ultimate Showdown and stuff. And like the prospect of doing Internet content was always one of the things that seemed like a bearable way to live as compared to like. Jobs that I worked and stuff.

Speaker
Yeah.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
Yeah. And before we met, I was listening to podcasts a lot at work, and I liked the medium, and I had had, like, a friend from high school who I did a lot of stuff with, and I was trying to get him to do a podcast with me for a while, but it was kind of he's one of those guys that's hard to pin down and get to actually do stuff. So I knew that I'd have to. Like, really carry the bulk of it and so. By the time that we actually met, I'd more or less given up on making a podcast. Although it was like an aspiration that I'd had for a little. While to do kind of like a comedy politics thing of some kind.

Aaron
Yeah, I always liked podcasts. I listened to them at work all the time, doing like hotel maintenance or even at previous jobs. And yeah, I just like the idea of, like, being able to look into things and then, like, talk about them and even my previous show was like a topic. Of the week format and I remember at the beginning thinking like, oh, we shouldn't do that this time. We should just have conversations about whatever. And the first three episodes were kind of like that, but we pretty quickly fell into a topic of the week format again on this one.

Speaker
4.

Aaron
Yeah. Oh, and for did you think it would still be going strong a decade later? It really depends on, like, what kind of mood I was in when you asked me, like, after we had produced a few episodes, you know, there'd be moments where I'd be like, yeah, this is going nowhere. But then there'd also be moments where I'd be like, this is the greatest podcast in all of history. We're going to become bigger than Joe Rogan. We're going to become the biggest ever, like the sort of duality of the content creator brain, the slightly narcissistic side of like I'm a genius. And then the other side of like this is horrible. Nobody's ever going to listen. And so kind of but also no, I would say mostly no.

Shawn
Yeah, I don't remember what feelings I had for the long term of the show. Like I always enjoyed doing it. I remember early on I was editing episode 6 and I lived in a house with like four other roommates and people were going out to a party and they wanted me to come drink with them. And I had this self-imposed deadline that I'm finishing this episode. And I need to keep working on it, and I remember a friend of mine being like, oh, come on, man. Like. This podcast isn't going to go anywhere and I. Was like, Oh well, ****. Too, it's going to go somewhere. No, but I I felt, I think I had a very workmanlike mentality. Of if we. Keep doing this. Then we'll see if it can go somewhere and like so. The first step is just doing it, and if it doesn't work out then it doesn't work out. It was a good experience, but you're hoping that it goes somewhere and there's an audience for it. And we're doing something interesting. We're having conversations that we think are different. We're doing the types of conversations that we wish that we were hearing on the other shows that we liked to listen to. So. It was kind of like following that logic of like try to make the stuff that you're interested in and then wasn't really thinking of how to make an audience or whatever, but like just thinking like this is what we're interested in if we like it, that other people will like it. But I still think the prospect that we'd be 10 years down the road doing like a 10 year anniversary episode, even with the more. Sort of grandiose. It would still be a very humbling, fascinating, interesting thing to. Imagine and the specific way that it happened, and like what we've done over the years, I think is totally different than what I would have imagined back then.

Aaron
Yeah, like I said, it was either the grandiose like we're going to be the biggest podcast in history. I don't know if I ever actually believed, believed that. But like you, you fantasize. But like, yeah, just.

Speaker
This.

Shawn
It being like, yeah, like having the studio and the staff and like. That kind of dream.

Aaron
Yeah. And. And like, you don't when you're just getting started with something like that, you don't know what that well, what would it even look like to be doing this in 10 years? It's like it. It's hard to imagine, like, impossible, really to imagine.

Shawn
I also I remember thinking earlier on, like in 2014, even being like feel like the podcast. Mark, it's kind of like saturated, like, there's a lot of podcast. Yes, that exists like we got to try to figure out how to do something interesting, because there's just so many. There's more shows that I can listen.

Aaron
To yeah, I don't remember feeling. I remember being like so happy whenever I would find the podcast I found interesting, and then I would go back and listen to like 100 episodes or whatever, like the whole back catalog, and then catch up. And then be upset that they weren't putting out even more constant content for me because I had, like, so much time to listen to podcasts. I was like, oh, yeah, no, this is like a it's an endless open field there. You could have so much more of this stuff. There's nowhere near enough.

Shawn
Right. Yeah, I remember you saying something like that earlier on in the show to when we were talking about the amount of listeners we had and stuff and it it felt like small I you know, we were getting listeners in the hundreds in the first dozen episodes or whatever. And like it was never something we paid that close attention to. But like, I remember being like, ohh hundreds. Shouldn't. Maybe we try to get thousands and you're like, no, no, it's fine. You know, people will find us someday, and they're gonna have all this great stuff to listen to. They're going to go back like I do episode one. And just listen to it all. And I was like, yeah, that makes sense. That's kind of how I listen to the show. That like too so.

Aaron
Yeah. And I don't even think we were getting 100 views like we've repurposed the feed from my old podcast, so that anyone who had been subscribed to that would be subscribed to this one. And then we told kind of all our friends about it and whatnot. But I still think it was only like. Yeah, maybe 100 for those first 10/15/20, it started growing even in the first year. But yeah, it's funny, you mentioned you would wanted to do a podcast with your other friend. With that, he was kind of hard to pin down and I think a big reason why this ended up working for us was that sort of like Workman like mentality where we. The. Just committed to it and kept putting out episodes, and even though we weren't getting a ton of listens, we kept doing more and we both were willing to keep doing it and keep putting stuff out for no pay for a long time because we we didn't even. The Patreon until a couple of years into it, but we both just yeah, had this really strong desire to, like, want to make something.

Shawn
Yeah, how we got started together. We had a mutual friend, someone that I knew through the Pirate Party and someone that you knew through the zeitgeist movement.

Aaron
It out raz.

Shawn
Yeah, and Raz Re shared a video that you had made, which was a. The video that was a reading of workers of the world relax by Bob Black and I watched the video and I thought it was great, like it was good essay and great video. And so I added you to be like, oh, I want to connect with more people who are doing the type of **** that I would do with, like, interesting politics. And then we were like Facebook friends. For I don't know, probably months and months without ever talking to each. There. But then I decided early 2014 that Facebook wasn't working for me and that it was like this weird addictive platform that I was, like, arguing with people on without any benefit. And so I made my little like, I'm leaving Facebook posts. I'm leaving Facebook. So like, reach out to me and we can connect. By text or whatever and like stay in contact while I'm off. This book and you reached out to me and being like, hey, I noticed that you live in Vancouver, so. We ended up meeting. Up. Yeah, because I was in a very open. We were both in a very open place in our life right then. I think like we. Were both really like, yeah vibe.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah. I was like, the Zeitgeist Vancouver stuff was going in a direction I wasn't really interested in anymore. And like, I had this podcast that I wasn't really doing anymore. And I was kind of just looking for other things or collaborations. And yeah, we met at that Cafe Cafe du Sol. May, which doesn't exist anymore.

Shawn
On commercial Dr. Yeah, unfortunately shuddered in the pandemic. It was a great.

Aaron
Place and we sat there and talked for like 2 hours. I think just about like all kinds of different politics stuff and I don't even remember a lot of. I remember that conversation being the first time I'd ever heard the words identity politics and asking you what that meant. Because I was very out of the sort of people interested in politics sphere like coming into it from a weird online conspiracy documentary turned utopian movement, I knew a lot about certain political things, like anarchist writers or ideas about private versus personal property. Or like I knew certain things. But then there were other things I was just like. Completely unaware of I was like ohh yeah, you know feminism. That's good or whatever. But I would just I didn't know. Anything really about like, sort of contemporary? Yeah. Identity politics, for lack of a better.

Shawn
Term, I think with the identity politics. I might be confabulating. I remember sitting in the booth there and complaining about that. I had a friend that I really admired and like speaking to, but that any sort of topic was always brought back and framed in terms of like these identity groups and this like. Essentialism, and I was like it's it's it's fine obviously like there's a there's room for that and it's valuable and it's and this is kind of like in the time where socially these identity politics kind of things are like washing through my political friend groups for the first time first maybe first hearing about it around 2011 territory 2012 but it's becoming really kind of mainstream. Where it's just coming up all the time and I was like, that's one lens and it's a good lens. It's it's a useful lens. But like, shouldn't we have like multiple lenses on things like every time we talk about an issue, are we always going to bring it back to identity essentialism and like, I remember it resonating that we're talking about like the multiple. Lenses thing and like the idea that you can look at things from multiple perspectives and like that was one of the things that was resonant between us where we were really kind of like hitting it off where we're like we're like, why can't we just be like really big brain then look at.

Speaker 5
Right.

Shawn
Everything from every angle and you know, like yeah, it's definitely.

Aaron
A big part of the show early on. On and I think we also really connected about kind of the idea of like post scarcity stuff or fully automated luxury communism, universal basic income, Internet culture, Internet Freedom, Drug War, just we we had a lot of overlapping opinions. Yeah, I think you I think if I remember you originally pitched. Like us doing some video content together because you came to me through that YouTube video and you had done cartoons in the past and maybe wanted to do them again. And I remember being like, what about a podcast like, I just had this one that didn't work out, but I still wanted to do it. So and you were like, yeah, sure. We could do a podcast. And then, like, very quickly because I already had mics I already had, like, set up to record or whatever. We I think we got together one time after that to, like, discuss what we wanted to do or talk about the show in general or plan. And then the third time. We met in person or hung out. We recorded the first episode of the show, had my apartment.

Shawn
Yeah, episode one was like our third ever in person conversation. And yeah, we had. We had a little bit of like we're becoming friends and we're like, there's kind of like that. Intellectual excitement of like we have different points of view, but we have a lot of shared basis and also feeling I remember feeling like it's kind of rare that I meet people that I can talk about all these different things with. Yeah, I was really excited about it right away and that first year we were just doing it every week and we every second episode was edited by either you or me and we just go back and forth. And yeah, one of the questions that we got here is how did you guys come up with the sketch slash discussion format and how much improv is in the sketches? And I remember during the production of the first episode, I was working as a overnight security guard in the downtown east side and. And I think maybe we split editing on the 1st episode.

Aaron
I don't remember.

Shawn
Because I feel like I was doing some editing and listening to it and I was like this, doesn't this feels like I want to do something else. I want to add something to it. I want to add like a sketch or something like that. And I this is like ancient. This is 10 years ago. But I remember basically like messaging you and being like, hey, I wanna add, you know, fake ad to this or whatever. I wanna add a sketch to. This, and you're like sure, go for it if you. Record it yourself. For it so then at work I had my like little recording setup was probably a snowball that I had this ****** USB mics and I recorded some like little sketch bits for that first episode and then over time it became like we started by doing like. The one fake ad or one little sketch thing for an episode, and then we were just getting good responses on the sketches from people early on. Like I remember having someone that I just knew through occupy on Facebook messaging me randomly being like, hey, I listened to this episode, and that sketch was really funny. They connected to this idea of like, oh, there's so many different podcasts. Like, we just want to talk and share our thoughts. But if we're gonna ask people to listen to us, then I feel like we gotta give them something a little extra. So, like, I think over that first year, we tended to do smaller amounts of sketches, like the first. I don't know. What is it? 40 episodes or something that we did like that weekly churn.

Speaker 4
Our.

Aaron
Yeah, I think Sprint, my memory of the first year is that we did pretty wildly varying amounts of sketches and like some episodes had a bunch like maybe three or four.

Shawn
Original.

Aaron
There and some episodes had none even like later into the show, we would still just, I mean, we still very occasionally do something without a skin or I don't know if, when the last time we. Did that was but 30.

Shawn
I mean the.

Aaron
One, yeah, there were no sketches in there. I couldn't remember if we ended up doing anything for that. But yeah, I think where it started clicking in the place. For me, or understanding it as more than just a a fake ad, like the idea of doing a fake ad made sense to me. I had even done a fake ad on the previous podcast and like just a it's an easy joke to do in like any sort of content that you're making, like a podcast, whatever brought to you by. A joke or whatever is like a a really simple thing to do, but when in episode 6 you being like let's do an entire episode where we just pretend to be characters who just love circumcision, and I have all these ideas about it, like we'll call it circumcision spectacular. Without the R at the end, because you're trimming a little off like a a circumcision. And I don't even think at the time we were both really into anti circumcision activism or anything, but we both were like, yeah, circumcision like routine infant circumcision is dumb.

Shawn
And it's also funny, it's just like and it's like a it's like a thing you're not supposed to, like, draw attention to. I was inspired to by MC Paul Barman. Had this song that I was. I listened to a lot of Paul Barman then and he had this song. If that was like critical of circumcision, it just it.

Aaron
Just seemed funny. That was like a big realization of what our sketches ended up being like. I guess in the end, which is a lot of the time us saying things we don't agree with. But agreeing with each other about them just inhabiting these like goofy parallel worlds. Where some major thing is like really weird or different. And yeah, it just kind of evolved over time to where we were like, OK, each episode will, like, record for a while, and then we'll do some sketches, pop those in. We can, like, add more information in the sketches or we can do this or that or tell a little story. But yeah, I think those were like the basic building blocks you wanting to like add some stuff to that first step. Episode and the circumcision episode just being this playful improv space of like, yeah, what if we lived in a world where, like, we're just two guys who just love circumcision?

Shawn
And we, yeah, we did stuff in that episode. Like, we're interviewing a crying baby about his circumcision, and we're just both saying to each other. Wow, he loves. It.

Aaron
Yeah. Ohh it looks so great. It's perfect.

Shawn
And like that's some of the that kind of.

Speaker 6
It looks so great.

Shawn
I remember being really proud at the time too, of just like getting so weird and just like committing to something because yeah, and I I had a background in improv like I did improv all through my like early teen years and stuff and like always was like a big fan of improv and enjoyed improv. Yeah. And so the the question of, like, how much improv is involved? Generally a lot is there's some exceptions. Especially it's a show went on is like we've learned more about the interplay between the editing process and the recording process. We used to spend a lot more time just riffing for a long time and then cutting it down where it's like eventually we figured out like, oh, we'll figure out the main joke and then we'll riff around that and we'll find some other interesting stuff. But there's also some times where we've, like, just basically written out a sketch, very scripted, although there's always room for improv and like we're. Ever. You know, shooting each other dirty looks over an improvised line. But like, yeah, especially some of the higher concept stuff is where we start doing a little bit more planning.

Aaron
A lot of the time that ends up happening for like the last sketch of an episode where we've set things up for two sketches, and we want to make sure to, like, pull it all together at the end. I remember writing out a bunch of stuff for the final wrong. Down episode like this part where they're like breaking into a thing or there's like, the smell of wafting cookies like I wanted to bring in all the characters of Ron Town. So I was like, OK, I have to figure out all these little things or whatever, but I I would say most of the time we just, like, talk it out for a while first. Plan. What's going to happen? We've made a lot of the jokes already off Mike and then we like, start doing it again and we're like new things come out as you're improving and. And sometimes we have to pause to be like, OK, how do we end this? Like, where do we go from here to, like, get to and ending? Or sometimes one just naturally happens. But yeah, it's it's pretty varied, I'd say.

Shawn
Yeah, someone someone asked. Can you do a lightning round of some of the biggest laughs you've had in the show? And I think overall it's hard because I've forgot. Like. A lot of the stuff that we've done, but like the circumcision episode is like a good early example of. Like time that we were just really following our nose in terms of what was cracking us up.

Aaron
Yeah, making ourselves laugh a lot the whole time.

Shawn
Yeah. It's like overall, like every episode where we laugh while we're making it be a very rare exception that we're, like, maybe something's going on in our life or something that we're not laughing when we're recording. And then, yeah, a significant amount of the time we're laughing. Really hard at least once. We'll do really high concept sketches sometimes, and those tend to be the stuff that like I think I'm most proud of in terms of sketches usually. Like one example is in. People's Republic of Walmart there's a sketch about like prices being updated in real time at the grocery store and stuff like a true free market. And like, that's the kind of stuff that requires a decent amount of planning and thinking through. You can't just like turn on the mic and just come up with it and that like, that's a sketch that I was really proud of. And like the Papa and boys series. I think it's like for me it's some of the high watermarks of stuff that I've ever written or participated in, like the radio series. I just think the type of humor and high concept satire that we're doing, and it is just something I'm really, really proud of. But it's not necessarily the stuff that's going to be making us crack each other up. We're, like, have to stop recording, cause we're laughing so hard. It's usually stuff like we were trying to brainstorm before recording of stuff that made us laugh. And like one thing that I remembered where I was just making myself laugh and I like, couldn't get out this line. And was someone whose genitals were eaten by wild dogs, who was like the bad guy at the end of the sketch, and it's like, and his genitals were eaten by wild dogs. And every time I tried to say it, I would like, laugh. And it's, yeah, it's just stupid. And it's crude and like a lot of the time, it's it's stuff like that.

Aaron
One that like ended up becoming an ongoing meme on the show because of how much we laughed about it during the first appearance was geek thing. This and just it being like this, just I don't know the name, just it's somehow so perfect. Like it sounds almost like a real name, but weird, but not like so weird that it's just like fluppy dizzle or something. It's like geet. Finkas. It's like something so perfect about it. And the original sketch of it was you mistaking. Me for geek finkas like not knowing my real name and me being like, Oh no, it's Aaron and you're like, oh, yeah, Geet, Geet finkas, I don't know. Like I listened back to the original audio of that recording recently because it was in one of our tales from wrong town things, and we are just having trouble breathing. We are laughing so hard at this like geek finkas like it's just absurd. You could even hear it now and be like I don't understand. What's so funny about that geek finkas like but. It made us laugh really hard and it became a thing we kept bringing back over and.

Shawn
Again. So yeah, like crude ****. Weird ****. I mean, stuff that will often make me laugh is as if I'm, like, surprised by how Aaron's improv character is responding to something that I'm saying where there's, like, this weird implication. Like, he's not just saying what he's saying. He's also implying this weird other thing that's like. Almost inhuman and its weirdness. That's like, that's something that's a big source of laughs behind the scenes, and also like where people are just violating all social norms according to some sort of internal logic. Like, that's often something that's making me laugh over the place where these things intersect, where people are violating social norms, like one example is early on we had this character, the naked primitivists. Like the joke being that you know. Clothing is technology, so primitives should be naked and like there's something where like his dad just accepts him right away and he's like, well, you should take your clothes off then or something like that. It's just so stupid.

Aaron
Yeah, he's telling his dad about it and he's just like, yeah, I'm going to go live in the woods naked. He's like, oh, yeah, you should probably take your clothes off right now then. Yeah. And he's like, do you want to just drive me out to the it's like, well, I could. But driving is a technology you'll probably just want to walk naked from here. Right. And like, you probably don't want to take any food with you because. It was produced by society so. But yeah, you know, no father would be like, yeah, go out into the woods naked and alone with no skills like, because of your beliefs. But this father is just like, I accept you, son. I accept your beliefs and I want to. Help you? Achieve them. So I'm just going to, you know, like point things out to you that you should probably be doing.

Shawn
Yeah. No and. Where there's that, that intersection between the weird wholesomeness but also this anti social social norm violation, stuff like that. That's always what's making us laugh. Like another thing is the we had some sketch where there's guys swimming naked in a pond and then like a family arrives. And we have this like silent family with kids and then our guys get out of the pond naked and start talking to them and like at one part, they're like, oh, I'm just going to pop a squat right here. So, like, you're imagining a naked guy like squatting in front of a family with children to explain stuff to them. And like, that's the stuff that's making us. Making us laugh.

Aaron
Yeah, it's just so wild. Another one we thought of was big baby stranger Milk, which is. Another thing is kind of hard to explain, but just the phrase came out where we were like, Oh yeah, like a big baby wanting stranger milk like big baby straight. We ended up doing an entire very short bonus episode.

Shawn
Yeah, 15 minute bonus episode early on.

Aaron
About it because because we just couldn't stop, like, joking about it. So we're like we'll just record this. Hey, everyone, this is the big baby stranger. Milk spectacular and we're like.

Shawn
Just I haven't really listened to that.

Aaron
Laughing our ***** off. I. Yeah, I have no idea if it's funny or if it's just us being stoned and ridiculous for 15 minutes, but.

Shawn
I I thought it was funny then for sure. Yeah, it still makes me laugh thinking about a big baby who wants that stranger. Milk. Yeah. He doesn't want milk from mom. He wants milk from a stranger. Yeah. And just yeah, that's just the repetition of it. It's like it's same with geek think it's like that we tricked ourselves into thinking it was funny by just repeating it so many times.

Speaker
And.

Shawn
We always like playing like the ******* versions of ourselves, like the naive versions of ourselves. And another a recent one that was like, really killing me was in the Evo psych stuff. The sperm wars sketch, where George Lucas is, like, reshooting the Star Wars movies. But it's all about sperm, Star Wars and new rope. And then when we figured out when we were sort of riffing. That it was real sperm being filmed under a microscope and that George Lucas was so influential like that was the direction Hollywood. Moving is like doing that, more like reshooting stuff starring sperm. It's got the it's got the crudeness and it's got the weird logic. And like the all the that intersection is where we're we're crying laughing.

Speaker 8
Yeah.

Aaron
Yeah, just George Lucas being like. Yeah, like. And it's one thing in that I remember just making me laugh is the like, because George Lucas is all like. So you know these timeless stories being told over and over again, and the hero's journey and whatnot, and being able to, like, take that tidbit of knowledge. About him and be like, yeah, you know, like I believe Star Wars is a very timeless tale. And I wanted to tell it over again in the new medium with sperm this time under a microscope. I don't know. It's a, it's very funny.

Shawn
Yeah, it's, it's, it's not even necessarily like our best bits or something like that or like, if you listen to the show, it's not always going to be the stuff that is funniest in the final edit. But that's kind of the principles that underlie. If you want to imagine where in the recording we're cutting ourselves out laughing, it's stuff like that.

Aaron
The Sean Villier show may contain adult themes in strong language. Parents are cautioned that this show might not be appropriate for children.

Shawn
Thank you. Thank you everyone. Hello and. Welcome back to the Sean Villier show. Today's guests are doing wrong unto those who have wronged them. The backstabber is backstabbed, and our first guest is Aaron Co, host of the Seriously Wrong podcast. Thank. You for being here. Aaron.

Speaker
Thanks.

Aaron
Thank you so much for having me. Big fan of the show and I am ****** at the back stab that I've been dealt. But I'm here with revenge.

Shawn
So your co-host has been doing you wrong. What happened?

Aaron
Yeah. See, this all started a few years ago when he didn't have anywhere to go for Christmas. So my parents invited him over to our family's Christmas, my family. Really, really liked having him over for. And the only reason we had extra space that year was because another aunt was out of town. And now because they had to decide between who to invite to Christmas the next year, they're inviting him. And I haven't been to my own family's Christmas for the last four years because Sean keeps going in my place.

Speaker
From me.

Speaker 7
Well, it's a despicable.

Shawn
Act and and he knows that you can't come.

Aaron
Yeah, he knows that it's either him or me. But he says, oh, he just. Enjoys it.

Shawn
Of all the low down dirty stuff that I've seen on this show, that certainly takes the cake, but I understand that you have a range to have some pretty incredible revenge on him. What happened?

Aaron
Long story short, I'm stealing his son away. I'm adopting his son out from under him. I'm going to be his son's new dad from now on. And he's just going to have to.

Shawn
Deal with it. He's reached an entire legal agreement and you've the the son wants to move and.

Aaron
The papers have been signed and he's out of his son's life. Forever. No longer has this son, and there's nothing you can do about it. All that's left to do is to notify Sean about it, because he doesn't know.

Speaker 7
Let's bring out Sean.

Shawn
I just enjoy the family's company. OK? I just. I enjoy his family's company. I enjoy his families. Hey, Aaron. Hey, it's been a pleasure working with you over the last.

Speaker 5
10 years.

Aaron
Yeah, I mean, we created some great stuff together.

Shawn
Sean, I understand that you have something you wanted to tell Aaron. Thank you very much. Yeah, I do. Aaron, you know, I just enjoy your family's company. And I've been fighting for you at these family dinner, saying we should make a spot for Aaron. Or maybe he could fit over there at the kids table, you know, dropping hints. Like, I think Aaron would love to be here for this moment and. Aaron's missing out on so much. You know, I'm saying this every year and I just think you don't have any right to be mad at me. I'm just politely accepting an invitation to people that.

Aaron
A friend would say no.

Shawn
That's not how I was raised. I was raised to politely.

Aaron
Accept invitation. You know how I was raised to get revenge. Well, as you know, when I get angry, I get even. And you stole my family from me. I've stole your family from.

Speaker 4
You. What are you talking?

Aaron
About your son is no longer your son. He's my son now. I've adopted him out from under you. He's living with me now. He has a new bedroom. He's moved in.

Speaker
These.

Shawn
Sean Junior would never do that.

Aaron
And he did. He signed the papers, legally emancipated, he's changed his name to Aaron Junior.

Speaker
You piece of.

Shawn
Little Aaron Junior is backstage and we will be bringing him out after the break. But first a word from our sponsor.

Aaron
We've caught up with people who just saw seriously right the wrong boys biopic outside the theater to get the thoughts of the average movie going. Citizen. Excuse me. Excuse me, Sir. What? What did you think about the?

Speaker 7
Hi, yes.

Speaker
OK.

Shawn
3 words Tour de force. It was incredible. Mind blowing. Best performance I've ever seen. Incredible script and just a touching story that moves the heartstrings and also makes you laugh, makes you think I hope they do a sequel, I hope. They do 2 sequels.

Aaron
I don't know what I liked best about it. If it was the cinematography, if it was the touching, gripping performances by the two leads Sean and Aaron playing themselves at every age, I don't know if it was the special effects, the music, they would just. There was so much to love, it was perfect. It was a 10 out of 10 and not like one of those generous 10 out of 10. I could give it higher if there was a number higher than 10 that was still below 10, but there isn't so. 10 out of 10 full 10 out of.

Shawn
Ten. Yeah, I would say it actually lowers previous ten out of 10s for me, down to nines. And I had to regrade the whole system because it was like up there, you know, in such a way that you're like, ohh, my favorite movie isn't so much my favorite movie anymore. So. And I realize that's really more of a 9.2 not. A10 and the whole scale has shifted.

Speaker 5
Yeah.

Aaron
Absolutely yeah. I experienced the same thing that 4 1/2 hours just flew by. Ohh how about you two? You're the oldest people here. I can see what brought you out to this.

Shawn
Film today? Well, I expected to hate it, but it was heartwarming. It was touching. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me feel.

Aaron
Again, you know, I've never heard of these wrong boys. I just go to whatever the matinee is every Tuesday, and this one was playing. But I gotta say, this is the best gosh stern movie I've ever seen. And I'm gonna be looking them up. I'm gonna be listening to these podcasts, and I'm. I just. I need more Sean and Aaron after all.

Speaker 3
That I think it might have.

Shawn
Here at a medical issue have been struggling with. Time will tell. Ohh you too. Yeah, I could swear that hip. But it's it's just not bothering me anymore. Yeah, I've got a very private and frankly embarrassing medical issue. Has been completely resolved since the second act.

Aaron
And how about you 2? The youngest people that I'm seeing here at the film, what did you think of the film? I liked the part when they were boys and making a podcast in the attic and the parents said no, but they did it anyway.

Shawn
I was inspired by their journey. I learned a lot about history along the way, and I've decided to get a job for children so I can contribute to their Patreon, which is a major theme of the.

Aaron
Film to formally announce that all funds from my future lemonade stands will be going directly to the wrong boys. Patreon from now on. That is amazing. That is amazing. Thank you so much, boys.

Speaker
Yeah, I think so.

Aaron
And I think we have an exclusive clip from the movie to play for you. All right.

Speaker 5
Now.

Shawn
Did you hear the new wrong boys radio?

Aaron
Hour, wrong voice radio hour.

Shawn
Boys Radio Hour is the best hour.

Aaron
Of radio, they're setting the college radio airwaves on fire. It's incredible. Every episode is better than the last.

Speaker 5
Mm-hmm. It's incredible. So it's it's on everybody's lips radio out.

Aaron
And boys radio.

Shawn
It's incredible.

Aaron
Come back everybody to long boys radio hour.

Shawn
The news and gossip on everyone's lips at wrong town college say Aaron, did you have beans for lunch?

Speaker 7
New.

Aaron
Well, I know, Sean. I don't think I did.

Speaker 7
Ohh Aaron, you dropped a Ripper.

Aaron
Hey, Sean, I saw that girl you have a crush on. Looks like she's going out with the quarterback of the football team.

Shawn
Ooh, that's gotta hurry. Sorry. What was that, Aaron? I can't hear you over the enormous noises of your own farts which are constantly ripping.

Aaron
Hey, shut down all this equipment. What did I tell you? Boy, this is a radio free college. Incredible.

Shawn
Dean. Crab apple. Hey, what did I tell you? Bro broadcast on the radio. That's not your career path. You guys are supposed to be in lower middle class jobs with questionable moral underpinning.

Speaker 8
Councillor part.

Aaron
Canceler snake heart. You boys are neglecting your studies for potential.

Speaker 7
You don't have.

Aaron
A waste.

Speaker 4
But.

Aaron
Time waste of breath. Waste of my time. Your time, your meager talents.

Shawn
Even without potential, you should be using it on something else. Radio's wrong. It's just not morally OK in our society to broadcast audio. It's just not.

Aaron
Right, boys specifically don't have the talent. Some people got what it takes and you.

Shawn
You for it. You even if you.

Aaron
Don't.

Shawn
Did you have a show? Would never ever last for 10 years.

Aaron
And that's why we've had to make the decision you're expelled.

Speaker 7
Ohh. Expelled.

Aaron
Ohh no, what are we going to do?

Speaker 7
So what am I verbally piece of parents going to say about this?

Aaron
Can you really make it in today's society without a college degree? I just.

Speaker 8
Oh my God, this is what are.

Shawn
We going to do I mean.

Aaron
I mean, I guess we're gonna. Have to strike out. Our own way.

Shawn
Yeah, outside the college system, we could do our own thing. We could do it.

Aaron
Our way? Yeah. I can't believe they expelled us, though. That was so seriously wrong of them.

Speaker 5
Seriously. Seriously.

Speaker 8
We were all wrong.

Shawn
I like the sound of that. That's.

Speaker 5
Yeah, the seriously podcast.

Shawn
Wrong podcasts, something we could do ourselves. It's outside the system, no repressive sensors.

Aaron
We could finally get back to our roots, like when we created podcasts in the attic at your place. Drop all these college radio cliches and we.

Speaker 5
Could just finally tell the. Whole truth. Yeah, the whole. Truth and.

Shawn
You've seen the people out there. We gave them a taste of freedom. What if we gave them the whole bag? We're going to show that stupid. And we're going to show everybody and we're going to do it.

Aaron
For 10 years, 10 years at minimum, all we have to do is believe in.

Shawn
Ourselves. Yeah. Put her there, pal. I got a good feeling about this. This seriously wrong thing. It's going places. Turn off the TV. Wow, I really, really want to see that movie. But I was already listening to a seriously wrong episode. I'm a big fan. I was listening to their ten year anniversary special and I'm part way through it, so I just put in these earbuds and hit play on this. Someone asked us how do you guys create the show? I would love to know what the process looks like, so yeah, the answer to this question over time involves a lot of variation and we always experiment with different stuff, but at a top level. Basically what it looks like. Usually we'll have an idea for what we want to talk about and we'll do some research. And then we will record for a block of time talking like this about it, and then sometimes on the same day and sometimes on a different day, record a handful of sketches on that same subject. On that discussion we just had afterward. It's and over time, we've more often started recording across two separate days.

Aaron
Yeah. Or even three or four. Sometimes those aren't full recording days, but.

Shawn
Yeah, like hopping on discord for an hour. Yeah, sometimes we do multiple different episodes, sketches on the same day, stuff like that. But most often, I'd say standard right now is usually like 2 recording sessions, one which is the main recording, and one which is the sketches. And sometimes we'll do more research after we start editing too is we're like ohh, it feels like it's.

Aaron
Missing this and yeah, yeah, we've been doing 2 like trying. To do fewer like 3 hour long, big episodes where we'd be like, oh, we recorded for like 2 1/2 hours the first day and then we recorded like 90 minutes of sketches. But there was still, like four things we wanted to talk about. So we're doing another recording day for that. And like that's kind of when we ended up in some like really long episode territory. We do that less often now, but.

Shawn
Still, sometimes.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah. And then yeah, it moves into editing, which, like editing, also, is undergone a lot of changes over time. But the the basic formula is that there's like a first pass at it over it, which cleans up the major things, removes off mic talk, filler words, that kind of.

Shawn
Thing, and sometimes on that first. Tests too. We've had other editors come in and do the first pass for us. On and off majority of the time we haven't, but it there's been periods of time where we have.

Aaron
And then the second pass is more like starting to put this stuff in order. Sometimes the conversations themselves need to be rearranged in order to like flow into the sketches properly or you're like this point we made is like the perfect lead into the sketch. But it happens in the middle of this part of the conversation. So how do we, like, arrange this to make sense? Try to do that less often too, because once you start moving things around like that, it can get really confusing. But there's like, yeah, second pass a bit more detailed, add the sound effects sound design. Try and make the sketches as tight as possible and then a final pass which is like looking for little things to tweak. Maybe some light rearranging, maybe tweaking levels or finding parts where the edits themselves made, like a weird noise or yeah, anything. Just a final Polish pass. And yeah, this whole process. Can take anywhere from maybe a week on like a shorter episode that we're doing it less intensely to. Like, I don't know, a month. If it's like a big long episode where there's like a.

Speaker 7
Yeah.

Shawn
Lot the most extreme version of that being like the the social ecology. Truly with all those different interviews we did and all the sketches we did, like how long would we spend on that overall? And this is all.

Aaron
Ohh yeah. Yeah, month, months and months of editing on that because like, yeah, there was all those different interviews talking about the same topic and then trying to weave the voices together in a coherent way with these little things that we'd recorded on the same topic. And oh, there was this great point they made. And like, how do I fit this in? And I'd like go back to the interviews and. Find another little thing I want to jam in. That was really, really fun, actually editing it and like seeing it all come together. But it was also took so long. It was like the most intense production process on anything we've done. And like you did all those interviews, basically without me, I think maybe I was there for a couple of them. So there was like, yeah, like scheduling interviews with like, eight or nine different people. Hours of audio to go through. Pair it all down, tons of recording sessions. I don't even know how many we did between us for all that stuff. It was. Yeah, it was a really big.

Shawn
Project. Yeah, and and it's kind of an example of like generally like how we split the labor internally is like Aaron is doing a lot more editing than I am especially over the last I guess five or six years or earlier on there was more of a even division there and over time it's kind of like. I'll be doing more interviews, more scheduling, more responding to emails, more research, premise, sketch writing, etcetera. And we we kind of like polarized in a way around skills affinities, preferences over time, although we we both do both to a certain degree. But like, since I've had a kid, I've been doing way, way less editing. And then when I was working on the pop and boy.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
Cartoon. You know, I was doing animation all the time, so I was doing way, way less editing then. Too and like. That's generally how how things are divided around these two pools, and Aaron's kind of the master editor on this stuff, at least from where I'm sitting. He does stuff on a higher level than I.

Aaron
Can, right? Yeah. No. Yeah. I feel like also, like, you just do. In terms of ideas for episodes like. I'll come up with maybe, I don't know, one or two a year or I don't know. It's like some of them come from conversations we're having. So it's not easy to like just say one or the other came up with it. But you're just constantly pitching me episodes like in Discord. I'll be like, in the middle of editing on something, and then I get, like, a block of texts that has like. Three suggestions in it, or like maybe for our next episode, we should drop what we were going to do. And here's like a whole bunch of other ideas. And I'm like. Yeah, I don't know. I'm. I'm editing. I'm not going to respond to this right now. But like, you're like, an idea generating machine, which was a big reason. My first podcast that didn't end up continuing on was I was like, I don't know what to do anymore. I've done 10 episodes. I'm out of ideas right now. Maybe I'll come up with more. Later but. I don't know what to do yet. Well, it's been really like complementary. I think like you feeling like you, there's not enough time to do all the ideas that you wanna do and also being way more willing than me to just be like, oh, there's three books I'm going to read, read all these books. Whereas I like, I'll do research. I'll read things in books. I'll control F in them. I'll read articles online like Googling things, looking at academic articles, reading encyclopedia pages, various things, and making notes. When I'm doing research, it's a bit more like shorter and targeted, I think, whereas you do a lot of like. In depth reading on things which I do sometimes. But yeah, the split is definitely I learn more editing and you learn more pre production research ideas. Stop.

Shawn
Yeah. And someone asked us, how do you typically engage in reading slash learning? I can tell you enjoy it. But do you take notes? Is it regular or just when the feeling strikes? And yeah, I mean, first, yes, we definitely take notes. Yeah. If we didn't take notes, I don't know how much I would retain. And yeah, it's like I'm a lot like, for example, when we did the episode with David went grow on the dawn of everything.

Speaker 5
Yeah.

Shawn
I read the dawn of everything cover to cover once, and then I did spot reading a second. Time and I did notes and then I gave those notes to Aaron for context, while we did the sketches, and while I was doing that, he was working on editing whatever episode came before that.

Aaron
Yeah, I think I read like a few small parts that you told me to read, and I listened to some of the stuff. Even David Graeber had been saying. About the book, before it came out, they had done some talks together about the ideas and I didn't read the book cover to cover. Yeah.

Shawn
Yeah. So right now it's I've got a young kid and it's a lot harder to read. Like I used to. I'm. I don't read a lot of fiction. I read a lot of nonfiction for fun, so sometimes.

Speaker 6
The.

Shawn
The direction of the episodes we take comes out of things that I'm reading that I'm like. I just I got to talk about this. But yeah, like, I feel very myself when I'm putting the time into it and I still don't do it as much as I'd like. But like, right now, I have three books. I've got my. I've got my 14 month old baby that I'm watching most days and I'm like, yeah, so I've only got 3 books on the go right now and. I've only read a few chapters of. Each of them. But yeah, it's it's something that I really like. Treasure about the production of the show and. Stuff. And yeah, someone asked Synchronicity Book Club why we don't do it anymore. And the answer is that we just forgot that it existed. We have a master document of all of our different sketch types that we try to like record for inspiration and synchronicity. Book club isn't in there for some reason. We did it years ago and the basic premise if you're a newer listener is like. And this comes from our very kind of like hippieish earlier stuff is like, yeah, synchronicity, maybe a book will resonate. The mention of a book will resonate with the listener and it's on the show. It's synchronicity book club. It's assigned to go get it and read it and the magical thinking world, the synchronicity. So today's Synchronicity Book Club picks. Are the tyranny of theory by Ronald Tabor, which is a critique of Marxism from an anarchist perspective that I've read the first quarter of. The second is loaded a disarming history of the Second Amendment, by Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz, which is about the history of the Second Amendment in the United States and America's unique gun culture, and how it connects to the colonial era, which you're interested in. That kind of stuff. Highly recommend this book. It's really mind blowing for the first couple chapters of that one as well. And the third one is full spectrum resistance.

Aaron
So yeah, if any of those strike a chord with you where you're like, oh, that's so weird. I was just thinking about America's history of the Second Amendment or whatever, and how it might affect. Things I've already forgotten. Some of the things you described. They're the tyranny of theory. If it's like if it just appears meaningful to you in a way that seems like something greater is going on, that means that you should read this book.

Speaker
Look.

Shawn
Yeah. And full spectrum resistance is about, you know, fighting and winning social movements. The history of movements, the whole spectrum of resistance, and how it contributes to movement winds. I've only read the 1st chapter of this one, but it's definitely a banger. I started reading it and then I got COVID and then I haven't picked it up since, but I've been listening to Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz as an audio book, which if you have trouble focusing on reading. It counts. I say this as a guy who reads books in text also, so don't feel like that doesn't.

Aaron
Yeah, no, it definitely counts. Another production question we got is when you talk to the audience during the podcast, do you look at the microphones or at each other or at a wall or window perhaps dying to know this one great question. People always ask us this like. Are you looking at your microphone or?

Shawn
Yeah. Generally we look at different stuff. We're not super like regulated or thinking about it. We we know we're not being looked at while we record. So we just do what feels right. But we kind of like look around the room and alternate between glancing and looking at each other. Sometimes you can sort of establish a rapport in a second, but.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
Making eye we don't do like prolonged eye contact, although it would be funny to imagine like the whole time we're recording, we're just gazing into each. Other's eyes.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
But it's like if I'm talking to the audience, I think I'll usually make that eye contact rapport. Moment with Aaron first to be like I'm doing something weird now. There's like eye contact can sometimes be used to be like establish. Make sure we're on the same page, you know, like someone's not thinking of the next thing to say or looking at their notes or whatever. If you're, like, establishing now we're talking to the audience kind of thing.

Aaron
Yeah, I think I look at you more to when I want to jump in. Like if you're talking and I'm like you start like leaning forward or like making slight sounds to just communicating like alright, wrap this up like I want to say. You. Something. But like a lot of the time when I'm talking to the audience, I'm like. Trying to think through what I'm saying, so I'll like. Close my eyes or yes, I don't know if I look at, I think I do look at the microphone a lot looking at it now. I'm like, yeah, I do. I do. Or I just look at the table or sometimes we have notes in front of us, obviously. So you're looking down at the laptop or the computer that's nearby, kind of look all over the place. But yeah, I'd say generally the. There's, like glances to like, communicate something you know? Like, I want to go. Or could we wrap this up or, like, what's going on now or I don't know what to do next or just like a smirking kind of look of, like, this is a joke. It could be all kinds of things, but definitely not staring at each other.

Shawn
Next up in the decade of seriously wrong listener mailbag, how did the library socialist idea materialize? Could you tell listeners a story about how you landed on library socialism as a term slash thing?

Aaron
Yeah, it's interest. There's kind of like two parts to this and one part is the term library socialism. And the other part is the ideas behind library socialism. And I think the idea is behind library socialism. Didn't come all at once. They were sort of like building up the whole time we were doing the show, and even before doing the show and from our influences and stuff before that. And when we came to the term library socialism, it felt like a way to encapsulate so many of the things we talked about previously and already believed. Like a coma.

Shawn
Yeah, I had been involved in the activism with the Pirate Party of Canada, which is like an information freedom profile sharing political party. Part of what really brought me into outside the box, radical politics, and one of the things we always talked about was the Internet as a lending library. The Pirate Bay is a lending library. The interesting through line. Between, say, like Napster and Lending Library, it's was something that came up frequently. Aaron came into this radical outside the box politics through the zeitgeist movement and the zeitgeist movies.

Aaron
Yeah. And so for people who don't know, which I assume is most of our audience, cause it's not really a thing anymore. And you might just know Zeitgeist from the first movie which talks about like 911 or like Jesus isn't real. It's like this Internet documentary phenomenon. But after the first movie, it became more focused on this idea of building a world based on science, where you can meet everybody's needs. It was a type of like techno anarchist, futuristic. Fully automated luxury communist type ideology that. Really, like sparked my imagination and like, has shaped my politics ever since. And like one of the things an example that they use in the third zeitgeist movie is they're talking about the difference between ownership and access and how ownership is kind of a burden. And like you own all. All this stuff and you have to take care of it and people don't really want to own things. They just want to be able to access the things that they want to use when they want to use them and how the lending library is like a really good example of how that can work functionally in a society. So they use that example to talk about the distinction between access and ownership. A. The library socialist ideas are kind of nascent in some of that psychisch movement and stuff, so it was a huge influence on it, and also, like Bookchin, post scarcity anarchism. It was kind of like bringing together all these different influences we had and we've been talking on the show for a while about these ideas and experimenting with different ways of phrasing things. And Sean had been saying, I think for a while like. Things would be organized similar to a lending library using that example of a lending library.

Shawn
Yeah, no, there's, like, multiple episodes. I can't remember the exact time frame. I know the first episode that we say library, so. Realism is running and hiding as a revolutionary act, which is a great episode, by the way. If you haven't listen, it was so good when we made we originally made it, to put it behind the paywall. This is like when we barely did any bonus episodes and then after we finished it, we were like we just can't justify only sharing this with 400 people or whatever was our on our Patreon at that time, even though it cost us money. People deserve this, but it's it's a really good episode. But yeah, up to that point for like several episodes. One of my little riffs of the things that I was saying over and over again because I really liked this, I had this joke with friends about in public relations and messaging, political messaging, that repetition is essential in the creation of. Truth is something that. I say like when I was drunk with my friends and stuff because it's kind of, it's like kind of magical sounding or like it almost sounds like some dystopian ****, but the the the heart of it is that anything important you need to say multiple times to make sure that people really understand it? Because just saying we chase novelty all the time. We love novelty, but we shouldn't let our love of novelty get in the way of our ability to be effective. Political communicators and repetition is essential in the creation of truth, so that's where this thing about like having these repeated riffs. Came from and one of them was that society would be organized like a lending library where people could have access to things that they want or need without the burden of ownership and something said in multiple episodes. And then yeah, it was in running and hiding where we did this sketch about the city state of usufruct, this library socialist thing. And I remember the time we were like really stoked. Kind of just like thinking this is super creative and fun and inspiring and. Really cool. And someone in the YouTube comments section, someone by the name of Connor Drake shout out to Connor Drake also did a theme song for us. Said you guys have been talking a lot about this library socialism stuff lately. When are you gonna do an episode about it? And like Aaron, read this out loud to me as we're sitting down to record one day and we were both like, yeah, we're gonna. Do that episode next.

Aaron
Yeah. And I remember, yeah, we sat down to record it and we kind of were just like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Like library socialism. And like, I don't know, we didn't have it all planned out when we started doing the episodes. But as soon as we started talking about it, I think we were both like. Oh yeah, this doesn't just make sense for that. One thing of like, Oh yeah, organizing society like a lending library. It also makes sense in terms of using less materials. It also makes sense in terms of. Libraries, being this bastion of, I don't know for lack of a better term, socialism in a capitalist world, they are this place where you can go and not everything is commoditized. You can get access to the wealth of human knowledge for free there. This place where all these different complementary parts come together to make something that's the. Bigger than the sum of its parts, like a complement. The hole and like we just kept finding things where we were like, Oh yeah, libraries do kind of represent that or they do enable this thing or they they're related to. It felt like discovering something really amazing when we were doing that first episode especially.

Shawn
Yeah. And over the course of the arc that we did of the three episodes, so we we. Already done, library socialism and usufruct. But I was reading Bookchin's ecology of freedom at the time, and at one part in the book he talks about usufruct irreducible minimum and complementarity. As these three concepts of like non capitalistic free associative societies and history. And seeing Usufruct had already been thinking about usufruct and usufruct actually got from Bookchin from some other source along the way. Yusef Rock You reducible minimum complementarity really sorted kind of. I was thinking about it, and like, these are the inversions of capitalism. Like usufruct as the inversion of private property, irreducible. Minimum is the inversion of being forced to work to live, and the ideology of complementarity, and like cooperative difference and so on, is the inversion of the ideology of hierarchy. And like often we struggle with defining capitalism in a way that we could ever escape it. Where like there's this kind of capitalism of the gaps thing that no matter what you do, you know, like all anarchist, socialist Communist projects throughout history, always have some form of market relations or some form of currency. Or there's some way that people like, well, it's kind of a market. It's kind of capitalism is still sneaking in there and like over time, it really sort of resonating to me that these are pillars that can. Provide a road map to inverting the logic of capitalism. So from that first episode it felt like it was coming a lot like we didn't plan out the episode very much. It was a very casually done episode and it just turned out so. Some we were so proud of. And then overtime it's like the resonance is only deepened. You know, it's something that just like, you know, when we started that episode, I didn't expect like, oh, I'm gonna start identifying as a library socialist primarily. And I'm going to meet other people who also identify as library socialist in the near future.

Aaron
Yeah. No, it was like. We experiment with different ways of framing these same political ideas all the time. And like, here's one that sounds kind of interesting or unique, or this will be a different thing to talk about it in this way for a little while. But yeah, it really just felt like we stumbled into something that like. Like you know, I would be willing to pick up a different label or shift or day, you know, whatever. If my ideas change or if there was some better way of talking about it. But it it really just doesn't feel like there is a better way of talking about it in terms of like getting across the things that we care about and the ideas that we have. In two words, like, that's no easy feat and library socialism, I think, is like the best. The best we can come up with.

Shawn
Yeah, asterisk so far, but no, I think it's really deeply resonant. And from conversations we've had with other people over the years and just like people bring stuff to us all the time, like, hey, what about this? Like, I was thinking about library socialism. I thought, well, what about this in this context? And it's like, yeah. It's like not only, yeah, but, like, holy ****. Yeah, like another layer has been unlocked. So, like, so they'll be like 2018 ish that this stuff.

Speaker
Right.

Aaron
Yeah, I think well the 1st. So it was 2019, but yeah, it was during 2018. I think where we started talking about libraries more. But I mean broader than that, like I started caring about psychism stuff and probably like 2011 or 20. 10 So there was like big, long build up. It was just like we both had our political backgrounds and through our conversations developed things that we had this broad base of agreement on. And then the language to describe it as library socialism sort of emerged over the course of a few months. There where we were through that running and hiding episode and then doing the the series.

Shawn
Yeah, my, my political kind of radicalization, for lack of a better term, too, was also like 2010, 2011, 2012. And that's where I got the first sense. Of like looking at the Internet differently as a library looking at copyright differently and then also the prospect of like utopianism being potentially good. I remember where I was. I was in Gastown where I used to. I lived at the time I lived above this pizza parlor that kept on burning down, and I lived above them. And I'm walking home through Gastown, and I'm like, probably smoking a joint or something. And I was like, we have a word for the best possible society. Utopia. Like, why don't we just use it? Like, aren't we all shooting for the best possible society? And I remember being, like, really captured by this idea of, like, why don't we just use Utopia?

Speaker 8
Right.

Aaron
Yeah. No, I remember you bringing that to me very early on in the show too, because in the zeitgeist sort of spheres, they were very much like this is not a utopian movement. No, we're very hard nosed scientific. We're trying to like discover the truth of things and engineer a society to meet everybody's needs and it's like. The things we're describing aren't utopian. They're realistic. And you had that kind of opposite approach of like, why not just, like, embrace, like, yeah, it's utopia. And we're, like, shooting for the best possible society. Why not like. Embrace it. If people are going to use utopian as a pejorative, one of the best things to do anytime people are trying to use something to insult you is to be like, yeah, no, I am that thing and it's a good thing. And here's why. It's a good thing utopianism is.

Shawn
Good. Yeah. And that was one of the things that made me really click with Bookchin early on, too. It's like one of the. Finding out that Buchan had this positive frame on Utopia, I was like, man, this guy gets me, this guy gets me. This is, there's this. There's something here.

Aaron
Ohh what the hell window?

Shawn
So was breaking into our.

Aaron
Studio in the middle of US recording our 10 year anniversary special. Who is that?

Shawn
Hey, hey, wrong boys. I didn't like that *****. You did. I didn't like that *****. I'm a huge fan, but I didn't like that one *****. You did.

Aaron
Ohh, which bit or I mean they can't all land for everybody but.

Shawn
Right. Mean there's something for everything.

Aaron
I I don't think we ever did anything to make people like this mad like.

Shawn
Did we not? Explain the clarity of the purpose of our satire. Enough once.

Aaron
Ohh no, we should we try to make it obvious.

Shawn
Sometimes to a.

Speaker 8
Fault. Would you just?

Aaron
Put the gun down or like point it down.

Shawn
Always the voice of reason, air and always the voice of reason.

Speaker 7
I'll show. You at least.

Aaron
Keep the fingers like away from the trigger as well, yeah.

Shawn
Trigger discipline. It's called right? It's good. Everyone says it's good.

Aaron
Always do that.

Shawn
Didn't like that ****** boys did when you did that fictionalized thing with that crazy super fan breaks into your studio threatening you. You know, fans aren't like that. People don't even like you that much. You know, it's kind of self aggrandizing isn't sure they what?

Aaron
Yeah. No, I mean, yeah, that was kind of like the point of I, I get it can seem self aggrandizing we were kind of kind of make fun of the idea of it being self aggrandizing.

Shawn
We had some of the same reservations as you. Obviously I mean. Yeah, it's now. Now it's not right. It's not right to talk about people who like you that way. It's demeaning.

Aaron
But the thing we just we know all of our fans aren't like that. So they'll see that they won't think. Ohh that's about me, they'll think. Ohh that's about some fictional other.

Shawn
Yeah. And I thought the meta ironic element that were kind of folds on itself kind of saved it and redeemed it and made it.

Speaker 4
Hmm.

Speaker 5
Yeah. Ohh yeah, met Ironica well.

Shawn
Yeah, actually, you know what, guys? I'm going to leave you alone. I'm gonna just creep out of this broken window here and just you can go back to recording. I'm.

Aaron
Sorry. Appreciate it. Thank.

Shawn
You I guess I didn't really get the meta. Ironic element, but yeah, I know it makes.

Aaron
No. Yeah.

Shawn
It it's definitely there. Yeah, we're actually very humble people. OK, well, thank you so much for having me here. Just going to let you go. Just go do your thing, do your thing. I've got a few more other podcasters and Youtubers on my list, so see you. Bye.

Aaron
Just don't go there either. Just go home, hang out at home. That's my advice. Goodbye. Keep leaving. Don't stop leaving. Bye. But don't go to other podcasters. House. I just feel responsible. I should tell you that you. Shouldn't do that.

Shawn
Yeah, I want to be patronizing because I know you're not really like that, but it's just better to. Never harass. Bye bye. Don't do that to anyone.

Aaron
Well, he was nice. Nice enough.

Speaker 7
Yeah, well not.

Aaron
Super nice. Yeah. Yes. I mean, maybe I'm being a bit naive, but I feel like.

Shawn
He meant well. Well, it's it's admirable. It's honestly admirable because you mean well about him, meaning. Well, right. And that's what means what? Rest of all.

Aaron
So true. Yeah. Anyway, you want to get back to what we were saying? Yeah. All right, next question. What is the wrongest you've ever been on the show? Ohh yeah.

Shawn
Juicy, juicy, juicy question.

Aaron
Let's just squeeze some of that juice out.

Shawn
So for content, I mean we've been doing this for 10 years. That's a long time. Yeah, we've been learning in pub.

Speaker
Do.

Shawn
And when you get into those early episodes, you have people who are qualitatively and provably more naive, less experienced.

Aaron
Yes, 10 years ago or in our mid 20s in the mid 30s now.

Shawn
Imagine there was recordings of you from 10 years ago. How embarrassed would you be?

Aaron
Look in content creator. Well, now I often see people saying things like ohh they said that two years ago. How do you even know they still believe that? Can you hold them too? So. You know, this is 10 years ago. Now. Really just building it up like I don't think anything that we said was like that bad. There was definitely like a different kind of perspective on certain things. Even though I think our political positions were largely the same.

Shawn
Yeah. Overall, really, I think there's a lot of stuff to admire. About our early positions and that there's a lot of consistency in our development and so on. But overall like I'd say, I think the wrongest. Thing and it's a trend that there's, like a bunch of little pieces to it that you can put together or say the first fifty episodes in particular, and then to a lesser extent, maybe the next 50 episodes after that. So the first third of our show, but the first six of our show, the most, is that often we were too conciliatory about ideological.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Shawn
Difference and we underestimated the dangers and we underestimated differences of motivation, differences of interests. Well, there's class politics across our entire show. We underestimated the kind of like sinister fish, like the threat of fascism like to us. Nazis were a joke. The you know, the KKK was a joke, that they were not serious, that.

Aaron
Growing up in the 90s, you're like, oh, we beat racism and it's over now. And everyone understands that it's wrong and it's kind of like.

Shawn
Yeah. Yeah. And so that's like the unconscious side. Yeah. Even though we're coming into recognizing what's happening in the world with racism and stuff, there's still this unconscious. Bias towards that sort of stuff and yeah, kind of an idealism in the pejorative sense sometimes comes through or a utopianism in the pejorative sense. They're like, oh, can't we just all get along that that that wasn't like our final full position on things and we always got into the nuance of stuff and like, we still believe in that to a certain degree, like it would be nice if everyone could.

Aaron
Right.

Shawn
Get along. There's a lot of circumstances. We're getting along. Is a desirable and possible outcome where others might think that it's not possible, but early on I think that that's if we're talking about the wrongest that we've been, I think it's in that territory and it's kind of a smattering of different things that happen across the 1st 50 episodes.

Aaron
Yeah. Yeah, I think like we had this kind of idea that like everybody means well. And even if they're like, wrong about how to get there, everyone wants to get to a society where, you know, people are happy and people are fed and like you have good lives. And like, I don't even think that's wrong necessarily. But I think the way we would frame it and talk about it at the time. Yeah. Like you're saying kind of like, downplays the danger of some of those other positions or people who like, maybe on some level, want what's best for everyone, quote UN quote, in some way. But their ideas of what's best for everyone is so. Malformed and deranged that they end up advocating for things that are, like extremely harmful to people, and I think we would have admitted even at the time that that was true. But it's just kind of, it's like a matter of emphasis, almost. That you can just end up in some ways playing cover for things that are horrible, like one example of this is in multiple episodes. Early on, I would joke about the idea of white nationalists who are like a joke to me that weren't a real threat, weren't a serious political faction that existed. Anymore being like, well, you know, if you love white people so much, why don't you just go create your straight White Island? You can all find an uninhabited island somewhere and just go live. White people all alone. Like, obviously you can't do that here because you'd have to kick people. Cloud and you know that, but you know you want to go create straight White Island like go do that. And this was something like we would debate people online and in Facebook groups and it would be like a, a little own you could get on them too and be like, oh, yeah, sure. If you want to just go live with all the other white people, why not go create straight White Island? It's kind of like a mocking thing, but it's also like lens legitimacy to their idea in a way that it's like. Reasonable to do that, and especially the straight White Island part is weird because like non straight people will end up being born there and then like they're kind of trapped on this straight White Island with all these straight people and that's ****** **. I think even one time I said like oh, you know, maybe we're at the point of history where, like with weird white. Nationalist freaks want to have a whites only. The bar that we've probably come far enough, that that's not a big deal anymore. I think that's probably like the single wrongest thing I've ever said on the show. And it's like, yeah, an intense version of that 90s liberal naivete that, like we've beat racism so much to the point now where, you know, we're at that point now, it would, it wouldn't even matter. Like everyone would see, it was a joke and it wouldn't harm anyone or do anything wrong and like, yeah. The political developments of the last 10 years last eight years have, like pretty thoroughly disabused me of that notion. I don't. I no longer think we're at a point where that's OK. I don't think there really is a point where that would be OK, like, it doesn't even make sense, because if people still want that, then that's the problem. Yeah.

Shawn
Totally. The racial exclusion is morally wrong. Yeah, yeah. And and to defend our show and and us as a unit here when. Aaron riff this I was like. Nah man. Nah, Nah, like no.

Aaron
Yeah, I think like. Yeah. And you were just kind of like, OK, like, whatever, like, not really into it. But I I brought this up multiple times. The straight White island thing. And like, the more times I would. Yeah, like an ongoing joke and.

Speaker 4
There was kind of a joke where we.

Aaron
You would be. More and more forcefully pushing back against it. As as a time winner.

Shawn
Yeah, until there was a time to, like, we fully repudiated and broke from this. Riff, because a listener asked us like, why can't there be like a white country or whatever? I don't understand why what the big deal like. I don't want it, but what's the big deal? And then we did this section and this is like in one of our early Q&A episodes. So this maybe between 50 and 100 where you know we we laid out like these are the moral issues with the, these are the logistical issues. With it, and like racial exclusion is completely wrong. So like no. But like I think like if you go back and listen to this stuff, I worry about making it sound worse than it actually was by like harping on it as the wrongest we've ever been because it's like a really minor thing. It's kind of a riff. And like this, very casual. But like that casualness belied a certain lack of seriousness on thinking about racism and so on. So it bothers us, and I think that's The thing is like thinking about the wrong we've ever been. It's very rarely like, oh, remember that time that we were like, everyone should vote for Hitler, you know, or whatever, you know, like, whoa, we were so silly. Back then, you know, it's not like that. It's just little stupid things like one that bugs me is in the 1st 50 episodes. I don't know which episode it was, but I know that's stuck in my brain cause I listened back to. It I was. Like. Oh ****, I shouldn't have. I made some riff about, you know, black mold is we're talking about black mold. And black mold is so dangerous and I riff nature is racist and I just hate that so much. And it wasn't even. Even if you listen to it in context, you would never think I'm endorsing racism as natural or something like that. But it's just, oh, man, it just bugs me so much. I've thought it like I haven't. Listened to this in probably. Seven years, right? But when you ask me what's the wrongest I've ever been on seriously wrong. Boom. That comes to my mind. Like it just stuck with. It's like that's just so the implications of that are so nasty. And racism is a social phenomenon of domination of humans over humans is not a product of nature. And the fact that. Racists try to make racism a product of nature, to hide the fact that they are socially dominating other humans for social ends, and they're creating racialized hierarchies to benefit themselves at the expense of other people. And this this was totally out of my mind at the time. Obviously like I'm this is this is 9 years ago or something. But God, it bugs me that I said that, and I wish that I didn't. And so I just want to apologize to the intellectual community for ever putting out that kind of vibe into the universe in any way. Wrong, because it's just so wrong. Like there's nothing racist about nature that that doesn't come from humans projections onto nature.

Aaron
Nature can't even be racist because racism is like an ideology that is held in like a conscious beings society or like either an individual or a social structure. It's not something that, like nature, can be. It doesn't even like. But it's like, yeah, it comes from like being naive in the pejorative sense. And just like not understanding what some of these things we're saying are kind of like playing it. We're talking about this like a couple weeks ago when we first saw this question. And I was describing the straight White Island thing. And like, oh, you know, I think came from this or this. Maybe to you and you were like ohh yeah. So it's like you weren't like deeply racist or something. And I was like. Well it it. It is a kind of deep racism, not like a. And hatred? Racism. But it's sort of like deeply ingrained ignorance of just not having looked into these things enough to understand why what you're saying is so wrong. So it's like, yeah, like, kind of deep racism, but not like intentional, vicious race. I don't know if you agree with that. Characterization. But.

Shawn
So you admit you're racist.

Aaron
I admit that I've been unlearning racism for my entire life and I'm further along that journey now than I've ever been.

Shawn
Another thing that really bugs me, it's recent. This is the most recent thing is the David, the David Wenger episode. We didn't double check the pronunciation of Teotihuacan.

Aaron
Ohh yeah. Teotihuacan. We did a. Whole sketch. We did a whole sketch, yeah.

Shawn
Which was just reading phonetically like hooked on phonics and like.

Speaker 8
Yeah, and we.

Shawn
The thing is, you're reading this whole book and you're working all these sketches and like trying to get the episode out. You're thinking about the next step. Sodas and we skipped the due diligence part of being like this is an unfamiliar word that we should be sure that we're pronouncing correctly because it's.

Aaron
Especially if we're going to do a whole sketch telling the story of this place like the TO2 with on sketch, yeah.

Shawn
And we're going to say it so many times. Yeah. And that's still in the episode because extracting it and replacing it was going to take so much effort that we just need to know.

Aaron
Yeah, if to rerecord the whole sketch and mentions later in the episode.

Shawn
And then there's the.

Aaron
You've already released the episode by the time we realized that we had pronounced it wrong, like it was like the day it came out. And we're like riding this high of like, oh, So what a great episode we just made. And then it's like.

Shawn
Yeah. Great episode. Everyone's good reaction. Great guests, you know, big new book. One of our biggest episodes ever. And yeah. No, just embarrassing. Just embarrassing.

Speaker 6
Uh.

Shawn
Yeah. I mean, in a way, that's the wrongest we've ever been.

Aaron
Yeah, in a way. It's another one I'll quickly mention is we did an episode early on called anti anti anti Vaxxers or something like that. Part of it was like us debating about. Vaccine safety and I had, like I mentioned, Zeitgeist move and it kind of come from this sort of weird conspiracy movement turned utopian movement thing. So there was a lot of, like, medical conspiracy and things floating around in these circles. So it took it. I took some of the things I was reading about vaccines a bit more seriously than I think were probably warranted, and yeah, I don't know. I'm just embarrassed about, like, arguing the anti vaccine side in the debate. That's kind of like makes me cringe. It's like, yeah, I wasn't like, I know that.

Speaker 8
That.

Aaron
Vaccines are bad. I think we were both kind of like, well, you know, we're not medical doctors. We don't know. But hey, I read this thing and like, I don't know, it's kind of weird. Aluminum and the vaccine, blah, blah, blah. Like. I don't know yet.

Shawn
But we used to, we used to do more episodes too, where like we would take a big issue and then each of us would.

Aaron
Yeah, just take this position.

Shawn
Self consciously take a position at another one like this is either the Trump versus Hillary episode where I argued full throated ally in favor of Hillary Clinton and you argued 75% throatily in favor of Donald Trump on which is the better option and.

Aaron
Right.

Shawn
Sort of the and like. I don't know, I haven't listened back to it. The premise is.

Aaron
A little embarrassing, but I remember us being like we both agree Bernie Sanders is the best, but who's second best? That's what our debate is about. Is it Trump or Hillary?

Shawn
And it wasn't. Yeah, it was. It was just, yeah, about exploring ideas. And over time, as we've focused more on kind of the craft of deepening. Episodes and doing like. Big entertainment pieces and and all that kind of stuff. We've kind of moved away from thinking out loud and playing with ideas that way that we did in earlier episodes and more towards presenting our conclusions. Our best understanding of issues in a in a intellectual climate where floating an idea is considered to.

Speaker 5
Yeah.

Speaker 4
Like.

Shawn
Sometimes there's kind of a repressive ideological climate right by floating an idea is like seen as a representative of your soul or something like that, cause you're like, look, I got this clip of Aaron saying that Trump might be better than Hillary or whatever.

Speaker 3
Right.

Aaron
Yeah. And it's like it's partially because people quote UN quote float ideas because they want to say the idea, but they wanna like avoid responsibility for saying the idea. So it gets mixed up and the but then it gets into this place where you genuinely like, it's hard to just float. An idea without people ascribing it to you necessarily, but I think also like the more people you have listening to you, the bigger platform you have, the more you know, you probably shouldn't just be floating. Whatever idea pops into your head, you should check and make sure that it's true. And I mean just even my like research abilities. Have improved so much since then, like I think a lot of those things I was saying about vaccines in that episode. I'd be much more equipped now to look up the answers to like, like I had some more experience in this when COVID and we did some debate. Thing we talked about, this person we debated on the election fraud issue, but we also debated him a bit on COVID no vaccine stuff. And then I checked a bunch of the claims about the COVID maccini and was like, Oh yeah, these are like none of these. Are.

Shawn
Actually true. Yeah. No. A lot of this. It just comes like, it's the naivety turning into a more informed naivety over time. Yeah. And being more. Yeah. And like, the, the floating ideas too is also that kind of like idealism and being too reconciliatory and so on, which in many ways it's admirable too. And I'd like to preserve that part of us to some degree as well.

Speaker 8
The the.

Aaron
Yeah. The the anti anti anti vaxxer episode was we called it that because the people who were against anti vaxxers were annoying me at the time because I was like you're not even just responding to what they say, you're not taking them seriously. You're just throwing dead babies at them and claiming their murderers and like you can't even have a civil debate about this topic.

Speaker 4
But.

Aaron
It it is that kind of again, like naivete and like wanting both sides to be able to have a real conversation and. Like everyone means well in this situation, so why can't we all just get along and yeah.

Shawn
So that's that's what we're most wrong about and.

Aaron
Yeah, that's a that's a. Those are like, yeah, the biggest ones that jump out to me at this moment in time.

Shawn
And we share that and full humility with our soft pink underbelly is exposed and say, if you want to try to use that against us, I mean, please don't. But do. Yeah.

Aaron
Or maybe I mean if you if you have like a hashtag, cancel the wrong boys, you know.

Shawn
Cancel wrong.

Aaron
It'll be like. Emotionally difficult for me if you do that, but it would probably be good for our numbers so.

Shawn
Yeah, our haters make us famous as the old hot topic hat says.

Aaron
What a deranged world this content creator life is.

Shawn
Yeah, that's true. No, I just hate it. I hate I hate when people get mad at me and I'm and I. Mean. Well, yeah. No, it sucks. Especially if I'm like, admitting I'm wrong, I'll be like I was wrong. I'm sorry. OK, it's nine years ago. You know, Obama was president. Oh yeah, on that in early episodes, I defended Obama like a few times, like probably four or five times. I would never do that now.

Aaron
Right, yeah.

Shawn
Next question from the listener mailbag, does it feel the same as the first time recording seriously wrong? The short answer is yes, absolutely in every way. Exactly. Yeah. No. The real short answer is no. Everything changes all the time forever. And that is the nature of things.

Aaron
Yes, 10 years ago, first episode we ever recorded was our third conversation in person. Now we're at conversation easily.

Shawn
So yeah.

Aaron
2000 it's hard to know. We didn't count. We should have numbered every conversation we've ever had, but we didn't keep up with that. We've known each other for 10 years versus like a month. It was brand new then we didn't know what we were doing. Now we've been doing it for 10 years. It's kind of like old, old. What's that? Hats the world hated this thing now, yeah.

Shawn
When we first started doing it, we had a couple dozen listeners, a couple, 100 listeners kind of territory. Now we consistently get thousands and thousands of listeners, which is it just a different vibe and feeling responsible for what you say and like? Yeah, I mean, someone told me that. I mean, some people have said I listened to early episodes and I. Didn't like it. I didn't like the early episodes when you guys didn't know as much and you weren't as good at making podcasts. But I've also had someone say I really like those early episodes because they're so raw.

Speaker 8
Right.

Shawn
It's just so raw you're not. You just don't give.

Aaron
A ****. You're just like unself conscious, unfiltered. Just.

Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.

Shawn
Someone else told me that listening to the entire run of seriously wrong has the answers to the life, the universe, and everything that it's really about more than just politics. It's about being human and hearing our journey over the years is deeper than hearing any individual episode. Yeah.

Aaron
Probably true.

Shawn
But yeah, it doesn't feel like the first time we we we've experimented with different production styles. We just have a I think we have a deeper sense of the show that we want to do and like what episodes make us proud and and how to do what we want to do and and also and I think we have a different sense of responsibility as well of like we want to help contribute to. People being able to advance the liberation of other human beings in the best way possible.

Aaron
Yeah, I think early on too, there was more of a sense of like just wanting to like express, you know, whatever was on your mind. And then over the years, you build up some things. Like you know, defending anti VAX stuff or straight White Island. And then you're a bit more like circumspect about like maybe I don't have to say everything that pops into my head there. There's some of that that's seeped in and just yeah, wanting to be more responsible. And I think too like at the beginning becoming podcasters or become. Being like a person working in a creative field was like an aspiration for us. It was this thing we were shooting for, and now it's this thing we've achieved and we're like maintaining it. And there's the kind of day-to-day grind of continuing. Produce podcasts. We have to edit and record and schedule and just sort. It's a it's a very different vibe in a lot of ways, still rewarding, but just. Yeah, very different.

Shawn
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's seriously wrong. Started as an escape from work and to us. It's our job now. Our primary job. Sometimes we do other jobs as well. The supplement because. It's very expensive to live where we live. But yeah, anything being a job is a different vibe than it being a hobby. But then also comes with that, a level of kind of like professional capacity and that we make just a much better show that I'm more proud of, that I think when all said and done, when people say like, what are the great episodes of seriously wrong? A lot of them are like yet to come because we're just getting more and more deep into these processes and the show. We want to make and we're learning more and more and. But yeah, so it does. It feels different, but in a non hierarchical way. Yeah, not better or worse, but different feels different.

Aaron
Yeah. Next question, what does the future hold for seriously wrong? And I guess the most obvious answer is approximately 685. Eighty more episodes. I don't know. I forget what number we're at exactly 680 more episodes bringing us to a total of. 1000 episodes. Where we will achieve 10,000 years of World Peace, that's a promise we've made since the very beginning and promise we still maintain.

Shawn
Yes.

Speaker 7
Absolutely.

Shawn
Yeah, not a naive early statement, but a wise early statement that we underline and.

Aaron
Yeah, before we stand. There's a reason that wasn't in the wrongest we've ever been.

Shawn
No, it's the writer that we've. Then, if there was a rightist, no one asked us, what's the rightest you've ever been, because it would be absurd. We'd have to be, we'd have to do a five hour 9 hour episode to talk about all the times we've been so. But not a mere.

Aaron
Yeah, no, it would. It would take another 300 episodes to describe fully all the time.

Shawn
Yeah, as long as you have a few smart cuts here and there and we just have to rebroadcast everything.

Aaron
Right.

Speaker 6
Actually.

Aaron
You know, it's wild to think, to reach 1000 episodes, we're about 1/3 of the way there, and it's been about 10 years. So it's wild to think that we would be in our mid 50s, maybe even a little more because. Our pace now is slightly slower than it was like the first year or two, so we might even be around 60 by the time we finally reached that 1000 episodes. It's kind of a mind folk to think of, but yeah, it makes sense. It's like a lifes work to build 10,000 years of World Peace. You're not gonna get it done.

Shawn
Yeah, actually. And I mean, just thinking about all the stuff that we've explored and learned over these last 10 years. It really does seem more feasible than ever that at 1000 episodes we will have set the groundwork for 10,000 years of World Peace. You know it's it's just one of those things that's true that you keep on saying, and it only makes it more true because repetition is essential in the creation of. Truth. And that's why we want to thank everyone, because it's not just about making a great podcast, although it certainly is. A great podcast. It's also about creating 10,000 years of World Peace for our children, grandchildren, everyone's children, grandchildren. You know, as James Baldwin says, the children of the world are everyone's. We all have a responsibility to all children. And we couldn't have got this far without you, our wonderful listeners, donors, people who engage with the show and spread the word about the show. And we can't get where we're going without being connected with even more great people like you, dear listener. But what might we do in the future? We might do video essays writing, definitely more podcasts.

Aaron
Better podcasts, let's say more podcasts is the surest of sure things, and then other projects like we, you know, we made a cartoon show a couple years back with means TV.

Speaker
Yeah.

Aaron
And that was a fun project. I mean, there's a lot could be said about that, but it was a fun project, happy about how it turned out. I think there's like a lot of things we could dip into. We could try, but I don't know. I don't. Think we know for sure?

Shawn
Maybe Aaron runs for mayor. I don't.

Aaron
Think so? Yeah.

Shawn
That was like the extrovert teasing the introvert kind of joke. Like, just imagine. Like you just hate that. So.

Aaron
Much, yeah. Yeah. Standing up and, like, giving a speech and being like, vote for me. Nightmare, nightmare world.

Shawn
That's why you're the right guy for. The job it's. It's a funny like it's a funny, like election common sense thing. It's like because people who want to run for office, right, they're like evil.

Speaker 5
Like right?

Shawn
See your face. So you really want to find someone you have to drag kicking and screaming to do it, and that's how you know it's gonna. Pretty good, but it's like actually well.

Aaron
I think that's true either, yeah.

Speaker 8
It's a lot.

Shawn
Of yeah, it takes a lot of work to and you have to like, know a lot of stuff. You're there needs to be some passion behind it. You can't just plop like Aaron genuinely doesn't want to be mayor, doesn't mean you put him in the office of mayor and he's going to like, rise.

Aaron
To the occasion. Necessarily. Yeah. The I think the logic there is like if you don't want the power. You're less likely to use it for horrible ends, but I don't even think that's true. Like someone could not want the power and then once they have it be like maybe I'm just going to, like, deposit some of this.

Shawn
Completely corrupted by it.

Aaron
It's a money for public housing into my private bank account and you know, whatever you know, just because you didn't want to be mayor doesn't mean you're immune to the the the draws of using power for ill yeah, I don't know. That was a weird tangent to get on, but.

Shawn
No, it's it's interesting though.

Aaron
It's we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know exactly what's in the future, but.

Shawn
If you do, please. Reach out.

Aaron
Oh yeah. Stock tips please. Or tips on how to build a successful revolution alternatively.

Speaker
Hmm.

Shawn
To transform society towards an ecological and Democratic commune of communes, where people are paid according to need and the world is run like a giant lending library that could come in handy right about now.

Aaron
Yeah, if your crystal ball tells you that, like, I don't know, crystal balls, they probably all work differently. And like it's hard to say exactly what every crystal ball will tell you, but whatever your crystal ball does.

Speaker 4
Even if you're a crystal ball expert, even they.

Shawn
Don't know.

Aaron
Yeah, it's always different. And every crystal ball is. Different. But you know, we're open to all information from the future. That's what we're saying. So please send it back in time towards us. And yeah, we'll use it to the best of our ability to do good. So yeah, 10 years, yeah, 10 years a decade. A decade come and.

Shawn
Gone. I mean, doesn't make sense. Time passes. I've always known time to pass, but still look.

Speaker 8
Yeah, that's.

Aaron
Yeah.

Shawn
Back at, you know.

Aaron
The amount of time that's.

Shawn
Passed. Still. Yeah, it's kind.

Aaron
Of odd since the start of the show, in some ways it doesn't feel like 10 years. In some ways it.

Shawn
Does. Yeah, I mean, seriously wrong has been such a integral part of my day-to-day psychology for so long at this point. It's kind of like, you know, like an old couple. Like, if one of them dies, the other one. Soon afterwards, right. It's like I feel like if if seriously run wrong suddenly stopped, like I just genuinely wouldn't know what to do. I'd be like, how do I what? Where do I plug this energy into? I've got all these like.

Speaker 8
Right.

Shawn
I don't think I would die though. No offense.

Speaker 4
But.

Shawn
What a long, strange trip it's been.

Aaron
Yeah, 10 years continuing episodes right here in this very living room.

Speaker 7
And continues to be.

Shawn
Yeah, this exact living room. Well, yeah. Thanks, everyone for listening for all 10 years. I assume you listened to the first episode when it came out, and then you've been listening to every episode as they've come out. So you've been on a 10 year trip with. This actually, but someone recently said something similar to that to us in a message that they'd started like in the first year or something. And they're right. Really cool, really interesting. But I know for a fact that the majority of our audience has found us over the last handful of years. Yeah. And I keep on running into people in public through left wing groups, so it makes sense, like activist groups. But they're like, I recognize your voice because I listen to your show and such a weird trip like that never happened before the pandemic. And I've been kind of like, more isolated. And then I had the kid and like, now I'm going out and I'm meeting more people, getting more involved in activism again. I keep on meeting these people who are, like, seriously wrong.

Aaron
Your podcast, right?

Shawn
Yeah, it's really cool. Yeah. I don't know what can you say about that.

Aaron
Thanks for listening everybody. Thanks for your support, your ears, your.

Shawn
Time and attention, yeah. Patreon contributions. If it applies, or even if it doesn't apply. Thank you for your future Patreon contributions, or you're thinking about Patreon contributions but not being ready yet. You're thinking about balancing different things, etcetera.

Aaron
Or even if you think about contributing on Patreon and decide against it, thank you for thinking about it at least.

Shawn
Yeah, giving a real consideration. Yeah. And even if you intend to do it and you never end up doing it, and you unfortunately pass away before you can do it. Thank you so much for bringing that to the grave with. You. That intention means a lot to us.

Aaron
Or if you. Leave if you put it in your, will that your estate will donate to the Patreon from now on until you know you set aside a fund for thank you for that as well.

Shawn
That would be so crazy. OK, so I mean, maybe this is too much to.

Speaker 7
Ask.

Shawn
But imagine if, like someone listening like left us money in their will. That would be ******* so crazy.

Aaron
Yeah. I mean, don't take it away from like your kids if they need it or.

Shawn
I mean, unless.

Aaron
You got a lot. Yeah, like yeah, depending.

Shawn
On like, don't take it all away from your kids, but like also you don't leave them too much. They might be ungraceful.

Aaron
Yeah, you don't spoil them or whatever. So I mean, you know your finances best and the needs of your loved ones best, but if you can find it in your will to leave us some money. We're, you know, we're obligated to to say that we we agree with.

Speaker 4
Or your life insurance.

Aaron
It.

Speaker
Yeah.

Aaron
Marcus Down is the beneficiaries on your life insurance.

Shawn
Leave us a house or whatever. Who knows? Yeah. Imagine we just, like, got a house in Kansas. The seriously wrong estate.

Speaker 8
Yeah, sure.

Aaron
Yeah, we'd have to move down.

Shawn
There. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not becoming a landlord. I'm moving there.

Aaron
Yeah, I guess we could sell it and buy a house somewhere else, but I don't know. We'll see.

Shawn
Yeah, we'll cross that road when we come to it very soon.

Speaker 5
Yeah, alright. Bye.

Shawn
If I everybody. We now go to the universe where seriously wrong never existed in the year 2024.

Aaron
So thirsty. Yeah, I could really use some water. So hot and food too. Yeah. Plants would be great. Trees for shade or fruits to eat. This barren storm struck hellscape. I would just settle for an end to the sandstorms eroding my skin away. I feel like I'm turning into sand.

Shawn
I would said I'll just have the dune wolf stop stalking us in.

Aaron
The night. Ohh. Where where did we go wrong? As a society had it all fall apart.

Shawn
Can't help but feel there was another way, but it's gone.

Speaker 8
Now my last shred of hope died.

Speaker 7
And that's what will happen. Wrong, boys, if you don't follow your hearts.

Speaker 5
Work together on this show. Don't let the setbacks drag you down. You're doing something important.

Aaron
Oh, thank you, miss old psychic.

Shawn
I'm so glad we turned. To you.

Aaron
What do you say, Sean? Should we set our differences aside and get back to what really matters making this podcast together?

Shawn
Yeah. I mean, what's 1 professional disagreement in a 10 year partnership? I mean, yeah, water under the bridge, old friend.

Aaron
Put her here. We'll just shake hands. Just sit down. Yeah, just hold on one second. Get a phone call. Hello. Hey. Ohh. OK. Thanks for letting me. Know. Hey, it seems like the Canadian government is passing new regulations on podcasts. You have to be a certain amount of patriotic, and they're going to be auditing all of our old episodes.

Shawn
Oh Gee, alright. I guess we can work with that. Oh, my. Sorry, my phones ringing. Hello. Hey, buddy, how's it going? What? Want me not the most. OK. Thank you. So apparently seriously wrong has been declared the number one enemy of the people by a Stalinist called called the Red Peoples Legion. Yeah, apparently they're telling everyone that our bourgeois utopianism is infecting the minds of the revolutionary proletariat, which makes us the largest and most powerful enemy of communism in the world, even ahead of fascists and Social Democrats, and so on.

Aaron
I don't think that's quite fair. I mean, that's communism.

Shawn
That's not how I see us at.

Aaron
All but well. I'm sure we'll figure it out. Ohh, hello. Whoa, really? How? Honey, huh? OK. How's our bookkeeper on the phone? Our Patreon numbers are crashing. We had hundreds of cancellations just in the past few hours. People are really, really angry about what you said about the Toy Story trilogy being better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Shawn
You can't cancel me for one little opinion. Just one simple opinion.

Aaron
And it's true too. It's not even like we can go back on it. I agree with that. You agree with that? It's.

Shawn
A great trilogy? Yeah, it's a family. Trilogy. It's just factually.

Aaron
Better than Lord of the Rings I.

Speaker 8
Don't know, it's just.

Shawn
Ohh hello. Hey. Good to hear from. Yeah. No, that's supposed to be our big break. I mean, what what didn't Jimmy like? If you change your mind, let let. Us know. *** **** it, that's The Tonight Show. They said that we can't do a tight 5 for them anymore.

Aaron
But we've been practicing for weeks. We're slated to record tonight, so you could.

Shawn
Apparently Jimmy Kimmel found something in the archive that he found objectionable.

Aaron
Be there tonight. You won't even say what it is.

Shawn
But damn, this is supposed to be our big break.

Aaron
Oh no, we just. We just resolved all our personal differences, but now we're at an even lower point than we've ever been before.

Shawn
*** **** it all this bad news at once. It's really.

Aaron
Suck. Yeah. Ohh. We just have to regroup. We'll figure it out. We we'll pull through this. We always do.

Shawn
All right. I'm just going to take a quick trip to the John. Just take my mind off this and.

Aaron
Yeah, yeah, you have to use the bathroom for normal bodily function things.

Shawn
Gonna go do some heroin, some addicted to it. Feels good. It takes my mind off this kind of stuff. So I'm just going to head over there and I'll be back in like, 40 minutes. And then.

Aaron
We can start working. Actually I this was another thing I wanted to talk to you about. I was going to do a whole intervention with your parents, my parents.

Shawn
Ohh for you to start doing heroin as well, no? Together, because I've been thinking. It gets us a little out of sync when I'm doing heroin, and you're not, so maybe it'd.

Aaron
Be better if we're both doing it. No. Yeah, well, I agree. We're at a sync, but no, the intervention was for you to stop doing here. That's typically what an intervention is. I know it started. Recreational for you. Just a bit of fun, but it's become a real issue. You know, the benders, the Sentinel ******.

Shawn
Yeah, it's recreation. I mean, I think I'm balancing it pretty well.

Aaron
I mean, I'm sure you're having fun. But look, we're facing more challenges than we've ever faced before, and I think we both need to be clear headed off drugs and at our best. On top of the ball. I don't think you're at your best when you're on heroin. And as much fun as it sounds to join you in the bathroom, I just. I don't know. Maybe the party's over.

Shawn
Well, maybe just one more time or or I mean, I can balance it. Well, I'm getting so much done. I'm so productive. And heroin is something that's kept me going since that Malaysian plane went missing with our producer and 3rd co-host Alex on it. It's really clean stuff. It's clean, good stuff. But maybe I don't need it anymore.

Speaker 3
Just look in this mirror.

Shawn
Maybe he's right. Maybe the party is over. Maybe it's time to put my head down and get serious for the good of the show. Maybe it's time to go to the library and study socialism. I could kick this stuff.

Aaron
What was that you said? The library socialism.

Shawn
Go to the library and study library socialism. That almost sounds like applying the principle of usufruct. Yeah, to turn the whole world into a lending library according to ecological principles. Yeah, yeah. I like the sound.

Aaron
Use of society.

Shawn
That that's an idea that's even better than a heroin addiction.

Aaron
Yeah, we need to develop this further. Those Stalinists and Toy Story haters are going to have to listen. To us now. That was an exclusive clip from seriously right? The wrong boys biopic, and now it is time to announce the winner of the 2025 Academy Award for Best.

Shawn
And the Oscar goes to seriously right the wrong boys biopic.

Aaron
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Other than if it had an armful of these Oscars now it's hard to shove another one in there, but I guess that after a long night, I mean, best cinematography, best acting, Best Original screenplay, best director. It's an honor.

Speaker
So much. Yes.

Shawn
To get a sweep like this. But it wasn't just. Us, I mean, obviously we have to thank the wrong boys for the work that they did on the podcast all those years. I mean, we couldn't have done this without them. Our producers were incredible, the actors.

Aaron
Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, Ron, boys as producers, Ron Boys as actors, they did great. And you too, I just want to thank you because I think individually.

Shawn
Oh, I think no thank you. You. You brought so much to it. Often we get credit as a duo and we don't individually get the credit we deserve. Exactly. I want to thank the Academy. You know, everyone who cast their ballots, they got the DVD screeners, as I understand it. And. Has been an incredible.

Aaron
Host. Yeah. Thank God. It was in the Jimmy.

Shawn
Kimmel here. Oh, and I want to thank everyone who pervades evil in the world and wrong. Thing, because as a political show, we're sort of paradoxically caught up in the external stress and drama of the world. So in a way, although they are opposite and we condemn them and fight them, we could have never done this without them.

Aaron
Yeah. And in terms of a biopic, we would have had nothing to overcome, right? Weren't for all of the evil that we faced on.

Shawn
The way, yeah, and I want to thank again the wrong boys for opening up about the trauma they experienced and in some ways reliving it on camera, which, yeah, was bravery. And it's other kind of small bravery of, like a firefighter or, like a search and rescue.

Aaron
That's brave of them.

Shawn
Operator or something like that. These people are well trained and they know exactly what we're doing.

Aaron
Right.

Shawn
I'm confident this is the bravery of someone who's stepping out into the unknown, which is a bigger type and more profound type of bravery.

Aaron
Absolutely, yeah. There is nothing braver than sharing your story in the form of a biopic.

Shawn
Starring you and produced by you.

Aaron
Said it, and I'll always stand by it and I think our sweep of the Oscars here today proves it.

Speaker 5
They.

Shawn
Next up after the break, the Oscar for Lifetime achievement in podcasting. Who will our big winner be tonight?

Aaron
I'll just pop out this tape. Ohh, that was such a career highlight when we won all those Oscars.

Shawn
Absolutely yes. It's what's even more incredible is that the 10th anniversary special predicted it accurately.

Aaron
Well, you know that we always had a knack for accurately predicting the future in our sketches. True. Yes. Even though they weren't recording, sent back in time, many of them could have been.

Shawn
Some say that maybe they. Are in a weird way, but not literally, but more like across some sort of dimensional thing or whatever.

Aaron
Yeah, I mean, my experience of it was that we recorded them at the time without any actual future for knowledge, just our intuition, and they all ended up being not only right, but note for note perfect sounding exactly like the real events as they transpired later on.

Shawn
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, great reminiscing. Right. But today, our podcast boy, yeah.

Aaron
The anthropomorphic boy.

Speaker
It's.

Shawn
He was kept alive his whole long, storied life by the generosity of the Patreon donors. But now, after we've done 1000 episodes, he is reaching the end of his journey. Yeah, he's a right bolt, you know, we were pretty young.

Aaron
I need to move on to the next.

Shawn
We started he's they were fairly ripe old age, his himself.

Aaron
I mean, many podcasts only live 1-2 years, five or six, but a lot of you.

Speaker 3
Couple of episodes even.

Aaron
He's lived, you know, many decades, yeah.

Shawn
And one created World Peace as well. I mean he's.

Aaron
Yeah. How many podcasts can say that?

Shawn
He's feeling proper chuffed. Last I spoke to him about all this, but he did ask that we see him off.

Speaker 3
At his deathbed so well.

Aaron
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. We'll just head over there, right.

Speaker 5
Now down the hallway to his deathbed.

Aaron
Boy Podcast Boy our podcast man. I guess now old podcast man, how are you? How's how's your last moments?

Speaker 3
Yes, ma'am.

Aaron
On earth.

Speaker 6
Ohh, I've been better. I'm sorry I was such a burden to you both.

Aaron
Ohh podcast. No, you weren't a burden. No, you you were the blessing of our. Life.

Shawn
You were the greatest. If I had that evil wizard was here right now, I'd give him a big kiss on the cheek and thank him for the challenge and the joys of watching my my anthropomorphized podcast, Childs.

Speaker 8
Yeah.

Aaron
Two kisses you'd be getting one each one from me and one from.

Shawn
Sean, he's gonna look like Archie between Betty and Veronica, he comes through here because we're so proper chef to have you as our anthropomorphize.

Speaker 4
Going to.

Shawn
Guests friend and you've overcome so many medical issues. It's inspiring.

Speaker 6
Friends.

Aaron
Yeah, lifelong medical issues and the really the generosity of the patrons really kept that at Bay for you. And what amazing things they did and what an amazing life you've LED.

Shawn
Let's open this door. Hey, wrong boys. Pizzeria your pizza in 10 years or less. Here you go.

Aaron
Ohh and with 15 seconds to spare. Perfect.

Shawn
Extra large Hawaiian, just like you, ordered almost 10 years ago, but not quite.

Aaron
Years ago. Ohh. Sean must have ordered that one.

Speaker 4
I am a fan. What can I say?

Aaron
Look, I have never had any problems with pineapple on pizza. You all know.

Shawn
That I was a kid when I first started eating this stuff. No one told me I was supposed to not like it. I.

Aaron
Just ham and pineapple go together. I don't care what anyone says, they just do.

Shawn
How's your business doing, by the way, after all these many years was?

Aaron
What 20-30 years now of actually fulfilling orders after your initial 10 years of not having?

Shawn
To you know, business is booming. I'd love to stay and chat about how great it's got. Thing, but we actually just have too many orders to fulfill right now. So business is going a little too well, but we actually now have a 100% delivery rate. We've really formalized the processes.

Speaker 8
Wow, that's impressive.

Shawn
We're actually the largest pizzeria in the world now. People have come to really value the kind of longevity and that kind of commitment they want to participate in something that is not. Fly by the night 15 minute operation.

Aaron
That's the thing I love about it most is that you order and then you don't know when it's gonna come in the next 10 years. But you know that it will.

Speaker
The.

Shawn
Thank you so much, but I gotta run. OK.

Aaron
See Ya podcast man. Boy, it's you know you'll always be a boy to us even though you're a man. Man, would you like some pizza? Your last meal?

Speaker 3
Yeah, maybe I'll wait a little while to die at a healthy old age and enjoy some slices.

Aaron
Ohh you give an old man a heart attack, jumping in here like.

Speaker 6
Oh.

Speaker 8
That someone broke into our our. Your strong voice. I'm angry at you both. I'm so angry at you. I just finished listening to your 10 year anniversary special. And you never answered my question. Ohh, I'm sorry. I'm just we don't have time for. We couldn't answer all of them. We tried our best.

Shawn
What's your question though? I mean, just shoot, I mean.

Speaker 8
We're thing I've always wanted to know. How do you get your interviews for your podcast?

Shawn
Ohh well sometimes we e-mail them, sometimes they e-mail.

Aaron
Us. Yeah, I mean, early on, we always had to do the emailing. But you know, after a while sometimes, but people started emailing us. But I mean, for the most part, we mostly do the emailing still.

Shawn
And we gotta give big credit to David Graber, who agreed to come on the show. He really just bumped up the caliber of guests that we've been able to get sense. He he really did us a solid.

Aaron
So what do you say when you put down the gun? Will you stop waving the gun in our faces?

Speaker 3
Want.

Shawn
Slice of Hawaiian pizza it goes to.

Speaker 8
Together. Ohh, thank you. Wrong boys for answering my question. That's all I've wanted to know. Let me put the gun down and yeah, yeah, I'll have a slice. Thanks.

Speaker 6
Looks like everything worked out after all.

Aaron
Ohh, you said it. Anthropomorphic podcasts on boy, man.

Speaker 7
You said it.

Shawn
And so the world was saved and humanity thrived for 10,000 years of World Peace. The end.

Speaker
I.
